I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕",,,,,,,,,17,162,13,27,13.666666666666666,237.7037037037037,6331.111111111111,0.037545337545337544,Tuesday,July,0,1,24,-0.101,0.928

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕",42452,2991,0,2042,true,public,"[array([[[0, 2, 0],

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕",,,,,,,,,11,149,25,45,3.977777777777778,36.111111111111114,669.8666666666667,0.053907908704883226,Friday,June,1,0,7,0.3595,0.928

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕",,,,,,,,,11,180,34,93,2.967741935483871,37.236559139784944,630.4731182795699,0.059061295494081935,Saturday,May,3,1,15,0.0,0.9655

(first time leaving Elton behind - emotional),"Guide Dog Care Instructions:

General care:
- Leave bedroom and sun room doors open at night so he can pick where to sleep 
- Clean his ears twice a week - use an ear cleaning sollution with one squirt in each ear, let him shake his head and then use clean, dry toilet paper to wipe out the inside of both ears - wipe til clean 
- If Elton is extra hyper, check his ears and bring him to the vet if they are looking red/infected - he displays hyper behavior when in pain ue to ear infections 
- He is not allowed on the furniture

Walks/Play:
- Walk him on the left side in a heal position, holding the leash close to the bottom 
- Elton needs 3 walks a day, do not let him sniff too much unless he’s doing so to find a spot to pee or poop 
- On average, Elton poops twice a day but occationally it’s just once. 
- Give Elton a toy from his toy bin when he needs extra stimulation and put it back in the bin so he doesn’t get bored of it. You can let him choose the toy he wants by giving him a few options and he’ll decide which one he wants to play with.
- If Elton seems really high energy, you may want to take him to the park before bed. Bring a large size ball for him to fetch 

Feeding:
- Please put the food in Elton’s bowl without him seeing you (close the door with him on the other side) when you open the door, ask him to sit and once he’s sitting, you can give him his command to eat  
- Breakfast is 2 cups of kibble around 5:30am. If he wakes you early, tell him no and ask him to lay down 
- Dinner is 1 cup around 5:30 with 2-3 bumps of fish oil and one scoop of his skin vitamin 
- Bedtime snack is after his final walk, and is 1/2 a cup with a probiotic package 
- Do not give Elton human food of any kind

0:24 - I literally woke up the next morning with my period… 

22:55 - At this time I was posting my guide dog training videos that had been pre-filmed so I thankfully didn’t have to film content for awhile and could just focus on my health.

23:22 - I had also been unable to workout since June, so I went from having a great workout routine of 4-6 days a week to being fully unable to workout and am just now finally starting to have enough strength to begin to workout a bit again.

0:24 - I literally woke up the next morning with my period… 

22:55 - At this time I was posting my guide dog training videos that had been pre-filmed so I thankfully didn’t have to film content for awhile and could just focus on my health.

23:22 - I had also been unable to workout since June, so I went from having a great workout routine of 4-6 days a week to being fully unable to workout and am just now finally starting to have enough strength to begin to workout a bit again.

WRITTEN ON THE SCREEN:

1:01 - I realized we actually sat down in 2019 before their tour / book and planned to do it in 2020 once their schedule calmed down… and the Corona said NO!
6:38 - **GDA not GDB!**
19:48 - Mira does a plastic bucket with a velcro strap instead of a metal claw clip and belt like adjuster strap because it’s easier for the people in the mobility program who can sometimes have limited hand dexterity. Since all of the harnesses are made at the same factory they keep the design the same for all of them to make it easier. They used to do a metal buckle / belt strap before they started their mobility program!
20:54 - Mine now with Elton John is 12.5 inches and it’s the longest handle I’ve ever had. Bennix handle was actually 11 inches and Gallop’s was 10 max… maybe shorter!

6:06 - I filmed this when I still thought I had captured footage of when he got home but apparently I didn’t because I was too focused on the “hot spot” issue!

11:50 I was on a work call when his grooming was done so my mom went and got him for me and he immediately ran in to see me and show off his new look when he got in the door so my call got interrupted with this cuteness!

18:38 - The PCR test came back normal, much to the vet/my surprise. We believe that it was most likely a doggy flu or perhaps a bad bug bite. The most important thing is that he’s back to his normal self and after 3 days of no harness work, we’ve been able to begin slowly getting him back to work again!!

31:15 - It was actually from West Elm! The target one was $50 and this one was $99 but SO worth it because it will last me YEARS versus the Target one that came broken!

31:29 - Both this eye pillow and the cat pillow were handed down from a friend, so they were pre-loved by them, not new so I can’t tell you where they came from!

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind!

Haha As a disabled person, every bit of independence counts, even if it’s something trivial because independence isn’t trivial.

2:56 - I want to be clear, we had noticed weight loss in these 2 months but it wasn’t until we went to the vet and he was weighted that we realized HOW much weight he had lost.

12:19 - I wanted to capture at least a little with him for you so that you could have your goodbye and maybe get a small bit of closure too because you all deserve that.

17:35 - Though I do admit I’ve wrestled a lot with it… feeling guilt, and a whole host of other difficult emotions around getting a new dog so quick. Ultimately though, I know it was the best thing for me to do for myself and it’s what Ben would have wanted

17:57 - I should clarify that I’m speaking about the guiding program - their waitlist for Autism and Mobility are much longer than their guiding program.

2:59 - In some cases, something you may want to ask yourself is, does this relationship bring me more joy or more pain? Your answer will tell you what to do next.

4:31 - Unless you want to or feel it’s important, then it’s okay to just be frank and share what your boundaries are and why it’s important to you to do this and for them to respect it!

22:53 - Correction… all of it was in a pandemic... lol

24:11 - In this case, we were trying to remain friends in real life and hangout like friends do, so I needed a bit more space to heal and separate romantic feelings from friendship feelings.

2:59 - In some cases, something you may want to ask yourself is, does this relationship bring me more joy or more pain? Your answer will tell you what to do next.

4:31 - Unless you want to or feel it’s important, then it’s okay to just be frank and share what your boundaries are and why it’s important to you to do this and for them to respect it!

22:53 - Correction… all of it was in a pandemic... lol

24:11 - In this case, we were trying to remain friends in real life and hangout like friends do, so I needed a bit more space to heal and separate romantic feelings from friendship feelings.

3:05 - Or is it checkered?
4:49 - they have since gotten one for Gallop and love it!
5:20 - **80 pound and 95 pound dog!
7:11 - ""Warning: Lous Squeak Coming""
8:21 - I literally find him with his head under the lid of his toy bin looking for a new toy at least 5 times a day! LOLOL
15:52 - I can’t even begin to tell you how many compliments Bennix gets when he wears his jackets, but especially the red and black checkered! 
21:21 - as stated… he has figured out how to stick his head under the lid to look for toys… he’s too smart for his own good!
22:00 - Lavender loves it more than Bennix does, honestly!
22:22 - I ended up finding SO many other cute things I bought him after filming this! Like an ice cream cone that you freeze so they can chew on it and cool down, and a bottle of wine that’s filled with a crinkle material with a speaker! LOL so fun!

WRITTEN ON SCREEN:
3:05 - Or is it checkered?
4:49 - they have since gotten one for Gallop and love it!
5:20 - **80 pound and 95 pound dog!
7:11 - ""Warning: Lous Squeak Coming""
8:21 - I literally find him with his head under the lid of his toy bin looking for a new toy at least 5 times a day! LOLOL
15:52 - I can’t even begin to tell you how many compliments Bennix gets when he wears his jackets, but especially the red and black checkered! 
21:21 - as stated… he has figured out how to stick his head under the lid to look for toys… he’s too smart for his own good!
22:00 - Lavender loves it more than Bennix does, honestly!
22:22 - I ended up finding SO many other cute things I bought him after filming this! Like an ice cream cone that you freeze so they can chew on it and cool down, and a bottle of wine that’s filled with a crinkle material with a speaker! LOL so fun!

4:55 - ""My 24/7 visual hallucinations due to Charles Bonnet Syndrome that I’ve experienced since I was around 8 have also been bothering me more than they have in YEARS… I don’t know if I’m seeing an increased number of flashing lights and colors, or if I’m for some reason just more focused on them lately.” 
5:42 - “One year in school one of my accommodations made was that I was allowed to go to school at 10:00am instead of 8:20am because my sleep issues were so bad and I was going for hospital sleep tests. I would get home schooled with the schools support for months on end most school years. I somehow managed to develop mystery lung infections, a severe vocal chord injury… you name it!” 
6:17 - “Before anyones asks why we’ve left it so long to properly deal with it… honestly, when you have so many health issues always happening, it’s easy to just leave things that seem less important to deal with later. It’s sad, because I know issues like this can be really serious and when they happen to someone with really good health, they deal with it right away but for me, I’ve dealt with so many health issues that some things I face just seem almost insignificant, despite the fact that they’re really important. I’m sure others who have dealt with many health complications can relate to prioritizing some health issues over others at times!” 
8:14 - “I also want to acknowledge that I’m aware how fortunate I am to be able to afford to work on my health in the ways that I do and to have had a family that prioritized my health and ensuring I get help over any other needs. I’m also lucky to have been born into a country with free healthcare and a dad who had a health coverage through his work. Many disabled and chronically ill people do not have the resources that I had growing up or have now and that does not escape me! I honestly don’t know where I’d be today with my health if it wasn’t for everything I’ve been able to do consistently over the years and continue to do now. When you deal with health issues, it can be incredibly expensive just to try and function and I wish more people had access to the care they need and deserve.”  
21:15 - “I always fear new diagnosis or developing more issues. I have so many random little rare conditions, like Protein S Deficiency Disorder, that was only diagnosed by accident in my late teens and I fear there’s more unknowns and messed up genes living in my body just waiting to pop up at any moment…”

Hearing their confidence and faith in me as a guide dog handler, and as an independent navigator made all the effort I’ve put into my O&M and guide dog skills SO worth it, and made me feel like maybe I can forgive myself for the skills I haven’t fully developed yet.”

0:47 - #realandrelatable 
1:43 - where I lived soccer and swimmer took place in the same season to as I progressed I had to pick one to continue doing at a competitive level 
7:08 - even with goggles on, the water can/will run into my eyes sometimes when I take them off because the rest of my face/hair is wet
7:54 - and when my head is under water I obviously can’t hear them + if there’s lots of splashing sounds that echo at indoor pools it becomes difficult to locate exactly where someone might be
12:09 - this is what they did for swimmers at the school for the blind that I went to… I’m sure they have better ways at the Paralympic level!
12:14 - 13:03: Time to get in, which is always the hardest part. I’m a baby about the cold water. Oh, that’s bright. Tummy is the hardest. Is it like that for anybody else? Just me? I’m lucky enough to have the pool to myself and when I have the pool to myself I sometimes just go off swimming in the middle, like, having fun doing hand stands and twists and I’ll kind of swim in the middle but when people are here, I definitely only swim on one side. I’ve gone to the side of the pool where there’s no stairs or ladders, because I’m trailing the edge of the wall so if I’m doing that with the ladder, I, like, hit the ladder. So, I go to the side with no ladder. I’m gonna dunk, put my goggles on and get swimming!
13:17 - 13:45: Hello. Oh hi! See? So the whole time, every time I was doing the breast stroke I would hit my hand against the edge of the wall and trail just to make sure I’m still close to the wall because, honestly, if I’m not swimming next to the wall and when I do have the pool to myself, & I’m just going in them middle I don’t go straight. I can’t. I can’t keep a straight line. So, I let my hand tap on the end of the pool before my face does which is always key. I’m gonna keep going.
13:54 - 14:03: Success! I love the pool! Oh, should I do some tricks? Should I show you my hand stand? Fancy, aren’t we?
14:12 - 14:19: I get disoriented when I do it, though. Let me show you my twist!  I’m gonna do a twist!
14:24 - yes… I am still a child at heart!
14:56 - 16:41: Hello. Oh hi! and then when I’m done swimming I just throw my hair in, like, a very loose knot with that elastic, Sorry, it’s very loud! And then I just jump out at the corner where I finish because I know that if i get out on this side all I have to do is take a few steps and I’m at the hot tub, which is always the best way to end a swim. So instead of going across to the ladder and trying to get around the pool, I just, you know, do a little lift up exercise and then I can just walk this way to find the hot tub. And one thing that is interesting is that I’ve never liked jets in hot tubs I feel like it’s almost too sensory overload especially if I’m sitting there trying to talk with people. It’s like, they’re bubbling in my face cuz I’m super short so the water always come sup to my chin. Short Girl Problems. sitting on the benches in hot tubs. and I just kind of feel over loaded. I don’t know if that’s a blind thing. it’s probably just a molly thing. Although My BF is also blind. and is the only other person I know that doesn’t like hot tub jets. So who knows? But I’m a no jets kind of girl. Ok, and now I’m going to get out and just go right to my right. Directly to my right to a sauna. Which I love a good dry heat moment. And it has color changing lights. There’s a dial and you can select what color you want for color therapy which I am going to be incorporating into my at home steam shower in my new place! I’m so sorry, this audio is probably horrific. So, yeah, I’m gonna go relax in the sauna. I really like it cuz it’s all glass. even though you’re very hot and sweating you don’t feel claustrophobic because its so bright with full glass! Now to dry off on these very cushy plush chairs and head home for dinner.

7:08 - even with goggles on, the water can/will run into my eyes sometimes when I take them off because the rest of my face/hair is wet
7:54 - and when my head is under water I obviously can’t hear them + if there’s lots of splashing sounds that echo at indoor pools it becomes difficult to locate exactly where someone might be

20:22 - I think this is probably what they meant and I just didn’t get it…? Also, I think my hand is just smaller than most people and because the handle is very chunky, much larger than a normal one, it is more uncomfortable with my tiny hands!

Stats and facts I shared:
- According to World Health Organisation, about 2.2 billion people live with some level of vision impairment, 36 million of whom are blind.
- 33 million Americans 18 and older are visually impaired and blind.
- 10% of 3.5 million have an income of $75K+
- Only a handful of beauty brands have invested in products and packaging that are accessible for the visually impaired (Vogue Business, July 2019).
- 55% of moderate or severely vision impaired people are women and girls (World Sight Day, 2019) 
- The total disposable incomes (post-tax) for working-age individuals with disabilities is nearly $500 billion. The total discretionary income is $200 billion.
- These billions of people want to buy person care or beauty products.
- Only 10% of the visually impaired community read Braille. Braille packaging can be technically challenging and costly to implement (CEW, February 2020; Vogue Business, July 2019).

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind!

I just moved to a new 2 bedroom condo and it was super hectic! Moving is challenging for anyone, but has extra challenges when you’re blind! Not knowing where things are, having boxes everywhere to walk into, having a new neighborhood to memorize with all new walking routes… the list goes on!

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind!

Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕

Shop some fun Aerie Lifestyle products! Below is a ton of fun products, all the ones I tried in this video, and even more that I love!

I'm Molly, a typical sushi, makeup, and fashion loving millennial girl who just so happens to be blind! I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I can’t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Let’s find them together. 💕

Molly vagyok, egy tipikus sushi, smink és divatszerető, évezredes lány, aki vak! 4 éves koromban diagnosztizáltak nálam pigmentosa retinitist, és 5 éves koromban kezdtem el a nyilvános beszédet. Motivációs beszédet kezdtem el, de most videókat készítek, sőt modellt készítek! Annak ellenére, hogy nem látok, tudom, hogy minden, amivel szembesülünk, világos foltokat rejtenek. Keressük meg őket együtt. 💕",,,7,115,28,1490,3.4436241610738256,36.705369127516775,999.7214765100671,0.03671559528325003,Tuesday,July,0,0,10,-0.4019,0.745

Questions
1. What is your disability and how does it impact you?
2. What is the most common misconception that you experience in regards to your disability?
3. Which misconception annoys you the most?
4. Do you do anything to combat these misconceptions?
5. What more do you think can be done to combat the misconception around your disability? [Society as a whole as opposed to individual work is a good direction for the answer]",,,,,,,,,6,90,10,1954,0.4390992835209826,5.885875127942682,114.49948822927328,0.05140525271306742,Sunday,April,3,0,6,0.0,-0.2457

Thank you for watching my very long and rambling RP experience video. I hope this educated and helped some of you, and remember, no two RP patients are the same. I forgot some of the points I wanted to make, o many in the future I'll make a follow-up video. If you have any questions don't forget to comment/tweet and I'll make sure to do an RP Q&A video!

Thank you for watching my cover of Colbie Caillat's song ""Try"". The lyrics in this song really touched me, and I felt inspired to do this cover for International Women's Day 2015. I'm sorry it's a bit late, but better late than never! Remember, love yourself. Please share with those women in your life who matter most, help them to realize they need to love themselves too.

Today, December 23rd, would be her 10th birthday. In honour of her, and the many things she accomplished, I am sharing this slideshow. These photos only show some of the amazing things she did and could not come close to capturing the incredible dog she was. Gypsy changed my life in too many ways to count. I can safely say I am who I am today because I had Gypsy by my side. She showed me how to love unconditionally, trust without fear, and to believe in myself when no one else did. Gypsy gave me the confidence and the independence I always dreamed of. Gypsy was stunning Labernese (Lab crossed with a Bernese Mountain Dog) trained by The Mira Foundation. http://mira.ca/en/
