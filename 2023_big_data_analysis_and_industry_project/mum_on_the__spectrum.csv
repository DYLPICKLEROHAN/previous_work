Trauma work should be done with a licensed medical professional. Taylor Heaton is not a licensed medical professional. Please seek professional support when working through traumatic experiences.

Unfortunately, autistic people are more likely to experience abuse and trauma. Trauma responses (fight/flight/freeze/fawn) have significant impacts on our bodies, and as we learn to integrate those experiences in a safe environment, we gain more control over our lives. This video explores the role of embodiment in healing autistic trauma.

Trauma work should be done with a licensed medical professional. Taylor Heaton is not a licensed medical professional. Please seek professional support when working through traumatic experiences.

Unfortunately, autistic people are more likely to experience abuse and trauma. Trauma responses (fight/flight/freeze/fawn) have significant impacts on our bodies, and as we learn to integrate those experiences in a safe environment, we gain more control over our lives. This video explores the role of embodiment in healing autistic trauma.

👂I love these earbuds because I forget I’m wearing them. There is a hole at the bottom so sound still comes in and doesn’t get muffled.

🌟 👉 BONUS: Share in your Instagram stories for an extra 5 entries (make sure to tag @taylor_heaton_ )

To snag your own pair of earbuds or explore the collection, go to https://www.flareaudio.com/MomOnTheSpectrum

The giveaway is open to residents in the US and Canada only. Must be 18 or older to win. The giveaway runs until 12:00pm CDT on Friday, September 2. There will be 3 winners and each winner will be chosen randomly and announced on Friday, September 2 at 5:00pm central time in my Instagram stories.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Women are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

You are a beautiful person worthy of love!

As a child, medical professionals said I was stressed, anxious, and shy. It wasn’t until I turned 31 that I was finally able to put all of the pieces together in a way that made sense. I realized with the help of a psychologist that I’m autistic.

I am not a doctor or medical professional. I am a 33-year-old autistic mom and I’m sharing my experiences to spread awareness of how autism presents, to connect others like me to resources and support, and to empower people on the spectrum to live confident, successful lives.

Please consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your healthcare routine.

Also, please note that relating to some of these traits does not mean you are autistic. It is part of a much larger picture. If you’re interested in learning more about whether or not you might be on the spectrum, you may find the following video suggestion helpful along with my playlist over the diagnostic process:

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Women are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

As a child, medical professionals said I was stressed, anxious, and shy. It wasn’t until I turned 31 that I was finally able to put all of the pieces together in a way that made sense. I realized with the help of a psychologist that I’m autistic.

I am not a doctor or medical professional. I am a 33-year-old autistic mom and I’m sharing my experiences to spread awareness of how autism presents, to connect others like me to resources and support, and to empower people on the spectrum to live confident, successful lives.

Please consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your healthcare routine.

Also, please note that relating to some of these traits does not mean you are autistic. It is part of a much larger picture.

# WhatDreamsAreMadeOf # IsThisMyLife

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Women are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Women are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Women are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

Keep in mind, these 7 types of ADD are not listed in the DSM-5, which many providers use to make a formal diagnosis. This exploration of Dr. Amen's work is more of an inquisitive look at how ADHD can present and is not a widely used set of criteria.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

This new perspective really helped me understand just how stressful this process can be for people on the spectrum and allowed me to utilize several new tips and tricks for navigating these types of experiences. 

In this video I’ll walk you through the air travel process in stages while sharing some of my favorite resources along the way. At the end of the video I’ll open up the bag I took with me on the plane and show you what I packed to help manage social anxiety and sensory overwhelm.

I’d love to hear about your own tips and tricks for navigating air travel in the comments below!

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

This new perspective really helped me understand just how stressful this process can be for people on the spectrum and allowed me to utilize several new tips and tricks for navigating these types of experiences. 

In this video I’ll walk you through the air travel process in stages while sharing some of my favorite resources along the way. At the end of the video I’ll open up the bag I took with me on the plane and show you what I packed to help manage social anxiety and sensory overwhelm.

I’d love to hear about your own tips and tricks for navigating air travel in the comments below!

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

This video explores some of the challenges of falling somewhere in the middle of the autism spectrum where needs can go unseen and unsupported. 💗

🟥🟧🟨🟩🟦🟪

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

As a reminder, I'm NOT a doctor, and any decisions you make regarding medication should be made with your health care provider. Do not stop or start taking medications without medical supervision. 

This video is primarily to share my own experiences with medication and how it has both benefitted and hindered me, in the hopes that it will help you find a treatment path with your medical provider that works for YOU.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to both lack of research and awareness. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

Meltdowns are kind of fascinating to me and I’m starting to gain more vocabulary and awareness to be able to communicate about them, even as they happen. I think if we can better understand how we end up in meltdown mode, we can learn how to plan ahead to lessen the effects or maybe even avoid some altogether. 🤞

🗣 Because I got on my soapbox (what's a soapbox anyway?), I’m also tackling the subject of kids and screen time plus how Youtube can better serve neurodivergent creators (check timestamps below to jump to a specific section).💻

❓What are some meltdown triggers for you? What things or activities are helpful to you in the recovery process? ❤️‍🩹

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

Meltdowns are kind of fascinating to me and I’m starting to gain more vocabulary and awareness to be able to communicate about them, even as they happen. I think if we can better understand how we end up in meltdown mode, we can learn how to plan ahead to lessen the effects or maybe even avoid some altogether. 🤞

🗣 Because I got on my soapbox (what's a soapbox anyway?), I’m also tackling the subject of kids and screen time plus how Youtube can better serve neurodivergent creators (check timestamps below to jump to a specific section).💻

🌈 TAY’S DESCRIPTION OF AUTISM 💃

Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social differences, repetitive behaviors, adherence to rules and routines, intensely focused special interests, unique sensory experiences/needs, and a restless mind. This can feel like a frustrating and continual processing or decoding of the world around them. Balancing these symptoms often leads to meltdowns where it feels like one is incapable of processing more sensory input or shutdowns where one needs to retreat to a silent place for an extended period of time before rejoining in normal activities. 

Many times these symptoms are imperceptible to others who are not autistic due to camouflaging or masking. Camouflaging/masking is the process through which autistic people consciously or subconsciously behave in order to appear more socially appropriate. This can affect body language, tone of voice, eye contact, word choice, and more.

People on the spectrum tend to find comfort and relief from overstimulation and overthinking by spending time alone, balancing their sensory experiences, stimming, and working on/studying special interests.

The way we process information through our senses can be overwhelming and add extra work to our already overworked brain. But there is hope! Mindful practices like yoga can help us de-stress, refocus our wandering thoughts, and find a sense of calm and ease.

This is a two part video. The first part focuses on the specifics of how yoga can benefit people on the spectrum by stimulating our Parasympathetic Nervous System. The second part is a 30-minute yoga practice that’s accessible for all skill levels, even beginners! And there’s no sweating involved, promise.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel. 

It's good for my brain to spend less time on social media, so you won't find me on Facebook or Instagram. But I'd love to chat with you in the comments! Or you can find my email address in the ""Details"" section of my About page.

_______________________

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel. 

It's good for my brain to spend less time on social media, so you won't find me on Facebook or Instagram. But I'd love to chat with you in the comments! Or you can find my email address in the ""Details"" section of my About page. 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0rQDkXDNeidKnUafldmpdA/about

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

This is simply not true! In many ways I feel we have MORE. But what can we do when showing empathy requires more energy than we can give? 

In this video, I'm discussing 5 strategies to help prevent burnout from caring for others. (Scroll down for timestamps to jump to a specific section of the video.)

I realized post-production that the list we share can get a little tricky to understand for us neurodivergent folks. We tend to be more literal, black-and-white thinkers, so I’ve replicated the list below in, what I think is, an easier-to-follow format.

10 Tips for Neurotypical Partners in Neurodiverse Relationships
(ND = neurodiverse NT = neurotypical)

1. Don’t speak in abstract terms (2:04)
2. Don’t treat special interests/concerns as trivial (3:49)
3. Don’t expect NT-level social interactions (5:47)
4. Don’t take differences personally, especially when it comes to how ND partners show (or don’t show) affection (7:47)
5. Don’t try to change your partner (9:48)
6. Don’t be flaky (11:15)
7. Don’t ask questions when the ND partner is busy (13:09)
8. Don’t overlook the need for the ND partner to have lots of alone time (14:51)
9. Don’t assume the ND partner won’t mask around you (17:15)
10. Don’t treat your ND partner like a problem to solve (20:37)

I realized post-production that the list we share can get a little tricky to understand for us neurodivergent folks. We tend to be more literal, black-and-white thinkers, so I’ve replicated the list below in, what I think is, an easier-to-follow format.

10 Tips for Neurotypical Partners in Neurodiverse Relationships
(ND = neurodiverse NT = neurotypical)

1. Don’t speak in abstract terms (2:04)
2. Don’t treat special interests/concerns as trivial (3:49)
3. Don’t expect NT-level social interactions (5:47)
4. Don’t take differences personally, especially when it comes to how ND partners show (or don’t show) affection (7:47)
5. Don’t try to change your partner (9:48)
6. Don’t be flaky (11:15)
7. Don’t ask questions when the ND partner is busy (13:09)
8. Don’t overlook the need for the ND partner to have lots of alone time (14:51)
9. Don’t assume the ND partner won’t mask around you (17:15)
10. Don’t treat your ND partner like a problem to solve (20:37)

MORE ABOUT SHUTDOWNS:
From Embrace ASD:
https://embrace-autism.com/meltdowns-and-shutdowns/
(Text below is an excerpt from the above article)

Things that trigger a meltdown or shutdown can be external, like:

Too many demands placed on the autistic person.
Unexpected changes in plans or routines.
Sensory overload.
Social overload — Being exposed to too much social interaction (particularly relevant to shutdown).
But the overload can also stem from—or be exacerbated by—internal triggers:

Feeling shame or guilt.
Feeling inadequate.
Feeling like an injustice has been done to us.

The straw that breaks our back (final trigger) may not seem to make sense. It may seem small to an outsider, but to us, it is that one drop in the bucket that makes it completely overflow.

In this video we'll explore proprioception and how it affects autistic people, specifically. I'll also share forms of exercise that help regulate proprioceptive needs and, with practice, might even help you manage sensory overwhelm.

I love to study all things health, but I'm not a doctor, so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.

I'm Tay, a married mom of 2 who was diagnosed with Autism at 31 years old. This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.

I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. 

It's good for my brain to spend less time on social media, so you won't find me on Facebook or Instagram. But I'd love to chat with you in the comments! Or you can find my email address in the ""Details"" section of my About page.

Females are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.

In this video we'll explore the phrase ""you don't look autistic"" and how this feels to an autistic person, plus things you can replace this phrase with to be more supportive for the autistic people in your life.

I'm Tay, a mom of two who received an autism diagnosis at the age of 31. At the beginning of my journey it was hard to find others who were in a similar situation, so I started this channel to share resources, information and products that have been helpful along the way. I am not sponsored, so everything I share is something I find genuinely useful! 

I’m also not a doctor, so please talk with your provider before incorporating any suggestions I make in my videos. 

Help me continue creating free content by subscribing to my channel! It's free and you'll get updated any time I post a new video. And as females are highly under-diagnosed, please share with any others you feel could benefit from this information to help spread awareness and acceptance.

What does someone with autism look like, anyway? Autism is a spectrum and presents differently for every person. In this video we'll explore the phrase ""you don't look autistic"" and how this feels to an autistic person, plus things you can replace this phrase with to be more supportive for the autistic people in your life.

# WhatDreamsAreMadeOf # IsThisMyLife

I'm Tay, a mom of two who received an autism diagnosis at the age of 31. At the beginning of my journey it was hard to find others who were in a similar situation, so I started this channel to share resources, information and products that have been helpful along the way. I am not sponsored, so everything I share is something I find genuinely useful! 

I’m also not a doctor, so please talk with your provider before incorporating any suggestions I make in my videos. 

Help me continue creating free content by subscribing to my channel! It's free and you'll get updated any time I post a new video. And as females are highly under-diagnosed, please share with any others you feel could benefit from this information to help spread awareness and acceptance.
