When you first come to the realisation that - gasp! - you might be autistic, it’s a really confusing and lonely time, and there’s not much guidance out there for what to do next.

This workbook aims to hold your hand (metaphorically) and prompt you to think about areas of your life which are relevant to an autism diagnosis, talk you through some of the diagnostic criteria in an easy to understand way, help you think about masking, imposter syndrome and how to talk to other people about all this.

This book won’t diagnose you. But it will help you gain more clarity around your autistic traits, and leave you better prepared for your assessment (if you choose to pursue one), and develop more understanding and compassion towards yourself.

The topic of autism in girls is highly searched for these days, and in 2019 I made a video called, ""Autism Symptoms in Girls"" , which has gone on to be the highest viewed video on this channel: https://youtu.be/ixRSb00BplM

But after much reflection I wanted to revisit this idea of ""gendered autistic traits"" and move away from the idea of female autism and male autism altogether.

I chatted with Purple Ella about this topic and we decided to do a mini collab where we both discuss this topic. Check out her video here:

The topic of autism in girls is highly searched for these days, and in 2019 I made a video called, ""Autism Symptoms in Girls"" , which has gone on to be the highest viewed video on this channel: https://youtu.be/ixRSb00BplM

But after much reflection I wanted to revisit this idea of ""gendered autistic traits"" and move away from the idea of female autism and male autism altogether.

I chatted with Purple Ella about this topic and we decided to do a mini collab where we both discuss this topic. Check out her video here:

Join me as I talk to Paul Micallef who runs the amazing ""Aspergers From The Inside"" for a live discussion about masking - why we do it, what it looks like, whether we should #TakeTheMaskOff or whether it serves a purpose? How can we live authentically while still masking? How can we convince people that we're autistic when all they see is a version of us?

We will also be telling you about the upcoming ""Autism Explained"" summit, which Paul has organised and I will be one of the speakers. It is an online event, running over 5 days from 21st September 2020, which you can sign up for free at: https://autism-explained.teachable.com/?affcode=285883_-1xdeg5m

This live is scheduled at a slightly different time from usual due to the time difference between me and Paul, so I hope to see many of you there or on the replay! Set your reminders now, you won't want to miss this!",309895,9557,0,5190,false,public,"[array([[[0, 0, 2],

When you are autistic, job interviews can be as painful as the dating process, you are expected to know the rules, but no one will tell you what they are.

Luckily, there seems to be progress in terms of how employers view the value of neurodiversity within their teams, but also support that's available for autistic people.

I spoke to Emily Banks, founder of Stack Recruitment, about her organisation that aims to help autistic people find jobs and educate companies on how their interview and hiring process can be more accessible for autistic people.

Stack Recruitment are London-based but can serve employers and applicants within the UK: https://stackrecruitment.org/

When you are autistic, job interviews can be as painful as the dating process, you are expected to know the rules, but no one will tell you what they are.

Luckily, there seems to be progress in terms of how employers view the value of neurodiversity within their teams, but also support that's available for autistic people.

I spoke to Emily Banks, founder of Stack Recruitment, about her organisation that aims to help autistic people find jobs and educate companies on how their interview and hiring process can be more accessible for autistic people.

Stack Recruitment are London-based but can serve employers and applicants within the UK: https://stackrecruitment.org/

Find out more at: https://go.onelink.me/w6CP/tiimocalendar (available on Apple, Android and desktop)

How I time block (or how I calendar block as some people might call it) is with an app called Tiimo, which lets me micromanage my week in advance and then sends me notifications on my smartwatch to remind me to start AND stop each activity. The timer feature lets me easily see how much time I have left to complete each task, and when paired with a Smartwatch sends out small vibrations to keep me on track throughout the day and prevent me from getting distracted (well ok, most of the time).

I use this app in conjunction with a paper and digital planner, and I hope to cover my whole organisational system in a future video.

É uma pergunta difícil, e como o autismo é um espectro e todas as pessoas autistas têm necessidades diferentes, você pode pensar que é muito complicado que você não queira se arriscar a errar.

Este vídeo espera oferecer alguns conselhos sobre como diferentes pessoas podem fornecer ajuda e suporte: parceiros, amigos, familiares, colegas de trabalho, colegas, chefes e gerentes.

Todas as minhas idéias são apenas sugestões, não há substituto para abrir um diálogo honesto com a pessoa autista em sua vida e aprender mais sobre o autismo em geral.

A aceitação do autismo é para toda a vida, não apenas para abril!

C'est une question difficile, et comme l'autisme est un spectre et que toutes les personnes autistes ont des besoins différents, vous pourriez penser que c'est trop compliqué pour ne pas risquer de vous tromper.

Cette vidéo espère vous donner quelques conseils sur la manière dont différentes personnes peuvent aider et soutenir : partenaires, amis, famille, collègues, pairs, patrons et responsables.

Toutes mes idées ne sont que des suggestions, rien ne remplace l'ouverture d'un dialogue honnête avec la personne autiste de votre vie et l'approfondissement des connaissances sur l'autisme en général.

L'acceptation de l'autisme est pour la vie, pas seulement pour le mois d'avril!

In diesem Video spreche ich über sensorische Empfindlichkeiten, soziales Interaktionsverhalten, Stimming (selbststimulierendes Verhalten), exekutive Funktionen (kognitive Kontrolle) und intensive Spezialinteressen.

Autisme Spektrum Tilstanden (eller Autisme Spektrum Forstyrrelse - alt efter hvem du spørger) er en neurologisk tilstand, der findes hos 1-3% af befolkningen - måske flere.

Jeg har lavet denne video til Autismedagen 2020, for at hjælpe folk til at kunne forstå, hvad autisme faktisk er, fordi der er så meget misinformation og så mange myter derude. I denne video taler jeg om sanseforstyrrelser, social kommunikation, ""stimming"", eksekutive funktioner og særinteresser.

Men hvad er ""masking""? Gør alle det? Og hvordan hjælper det os?

I denne video ser jeg nærmere på nyere forskning om emnet. Man har identificeret fire forskellige typer af ""kompensationsstrategier""; forskellige måder som autister bruger til at skjule deres virkelige selv for at kunne passe ind ifht. venner, at få et arbejde eller en forfremmelse eller bare for at kunne fungere og leve i den neurotypiske verden.

I talk about my personal experiences of religion and why I am an atheist, the appeal of religion for autistic people (but also but it might not appeal), the historical role of clergy, and a few problematic ways in which religion could manipulate autistic people.

By the way, forgot to mention what my Masters degree was in: Religion in Contemporary Society!

Why functioning labels hurt us,"High or low functioning autism? Both are unhelpful terms

This video is all about high functioning autism (adult), and why I believe we need to stop calling autistic people high or low functioning.

I talk about how functioning labels came about, a little about Asperger’s syndrome and the DSM V change, and why functioning labels ultimately harm all autistic people.

As always, this is just my opinion, I don’t speak for anyone other than myself, but let’s try and keep it civil in the comments please! ;) 

Framing this argument as a battle between low functioning autism vs high functioning is unhelpful because a lot of the accommodations we might need end up being the same, even though our outward presentation may be different.

Denne video handler om højtfungerende autisme (hos voksne) og om, hvorfor jeg mener, at vi skal holde op med at kalde autister for højt- eller lavtfungerende.

Jeg taler om, hvordan disse beskrivelser blev til, lidt om Aspergers og ændringerne i DSM 5, og om hvordan funktionsbeskrivelserne i sidste ende skader alle autister.

Som altid er det MIN holdning, jeg taler ikke for andre end mig selv, så hold en god tone i kommentarerne, tak! ;-)

Når man fremstille dette som en kamp mellem de lavt- og højtfungerende autister, så er det til stor skade, fordi meget af den støtte, som vi har brug for, i sidste ende er den samme, selvom vi ser meget forskellige ud.

In this video, I talk through my own answers to the test.

This was a collab with Indie Andy, who also took the AQ test on his own channel. Check out his video right here:

https://youtu.be/BEx4nBQcKj0

This week, Indie Andy and I decided to both take the AQ (autism quotient) test to see how good it is at accurately identifying autistic traits. I personally have a lot of criticisms of the test and some of the questions. As you can see in the video, a lot of them are open to wild interpretation, and I think that this is potentially missing a lot of autistic people in the screening process because of the somewhat outdated stereotypes of autism it perpetuates.

(You can also take the AQ test online here: https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient)

Interested to know what you guys think about the test as well!

O modelo atual de diagnóstico do autismo é baseado na suposição de que os traços de autismo serão vistos na primeira infância. De fato, é frequentemente considerado um distúrbio infantil. Mas a quantidade de adultos autistas diagnosticados tardiamente significa que claramente esse modelo está falhando em alguma coisa e, em vez de uma abordagem de fora para dentro, precisamos começar a pensar em uma abordagem de dentro para fora - ouvindo as experiências internas de pessoas autistas, em vez de ter pesquisadores neurotípicos descrever o que eles acham que veem.

¿Podrías ser autista y no saberlo? Yo, y muchos otros adultos con un diagnóstico tardío del autismo, te dirán - ¡SÍ!

El modelo actual del diagnóstico del autismo se basa en la asunción que los rasgos del autismo aparecen en la infancia. Pero la cantidad de diagnósticos de autismo tardío en adultos demuestra que ese modelo está perdiendo algo, en lugar de realizar una aproximación desde el exterior, necesitamos empezar a pensar en tener una aproximación desde el interior, escuchando las experiencias internas de gente autista, en lugar de tener investigadores neurotípicos describiendo lo que ellos piensan y ven.

Jeg - og mange andre voksne autister, der har fået en diagnose sent i livet - kan give dig svaret: JA! Det er muligt! 

Den fremherskende model for autismediagnosticering bygger på en formodning om, at autismetræk vil vise sig i den tidlige barndom. Faktisk ses autisme ofte som en børne-lidelse. 

Men antallet af sent diagnosticerede voksne autister betyder, at det er klart, at denne model overser noget, og i stedet for en udefra-og-ind-tilgang, skal vi begynde at tænke mere indefra-og-ud: vi skal lytte til de indre erfaringer, som autister har, i stedet for at lade neurotypiske forskere beskrive, hvad de tror, de ser.

Нынешняя модель представлений о диагнозе аутизма строится на предположении, что аутичные черты проявляют себя в раннем детстве. Его даже зачастую рассматривают как детское расстройство.  Но количество аутичных людей, диагностированных во взрослом возрасте, чётко показывает, что в этой модели чего-то явно не хватает, и что вместо рассмотрения внешних проявлений, нам нужно начать думать о проявлениях внутренних - прислушиваться к внутренним переживаниям и опыту аутичных людей, вместо того, чтобы позволять нейротипичным исследователям описывать, что, как им кажется, они видят.

Если вам кажется, что это описывает вас как нельзя лучше - вот ещё немного ресурсов для дальнейшего исследования. Пожалуйста, помните, что как бы близко вы себя не ощущали ко всем перечисленным пунктам, это НЕ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО означает, что вы аутичны - существует довольно много других расстройств, которые могут у вас быть, так что, пожалуйста. если вы заинтересованы в диагнозе, посетите специалиста.

Demisexual people have a very specific way of experiencing sexual attraction.

Demisexuality is basically when you don't feel sexual attraction to other people unless some sort of strong bond or emotional connection has been made. With the prefix “demi” meaning “half”, you could think of it as halfway onto the asexual spectrum. They are often known as ""gray ace"".

This relates to autism in a variety of ways - sensory/touch, relating to other people and building meaningful relationships, and understanding others intentions.

Demisexual people have a very specific way of experiencing sexual attraction.

Demisexuality is basically when you don't feel sexual attraction to other people unless some sort of strong bond or emotional connection has been made. With the prefix “demi” meaning “half”, you could think of it as halfway onto the asexual spectrum. They are often known as ""gray ace"".

This relates to autism in a variety of ways - sensory/touch, relating to other people and building meaningful relationships, and understanding others intentions.

What benefits have you been encountering from being open about your autism diagnosis, and how do you deal innerly with the negative ones?

Doesn't it scare you the idea of having a kid who has a high probability of being autistic?

How do you tell your friends and family that you are autistic?

Did you ever think you also have ADHD? There seems to be much overlap with executive function.

If you had a diagnosis before kids what would you have done to get ready for the overwhelm?

How did you end up in the Netherlands? Is your husband Dutch?

As an undiagnosed autistic child, I thought of myself back then as “fussy”, whereas now I can appreciate the sensory sensitivities and aversions to food texture that are common in autistic people, and reframe my past self as an autistic child with food aversions.

In this video, I’m discussing my food habits as a child (and an adult) and what I think the people around me could have done to help me eat a better diet at the time.

As an undiagnosed autistic child, I thought of myself back then as “fussy”, whereas now I can appreciate the sensory sensitivities and aversions to food texture that are common in autistic people, and reframe my past self as an autistic child with food aversions.

In this video, I’m discussing my food habits as a child (and an adult) and what I think the people around me could have done to help me eat a better diet at the time.

My working theory is that it’s a combination of factors. Autistic people are very sensitive and constantly processing sensory stimuli. Secondly, many (mostly)neurotypical people make thin-slice judgements, that is snap judgements about whether a person is “one of us”, within a matter of seconds.

Even autistic people who mask a lot can give away certain “tells” that they deviate from the norm, because you can get so far by masking and “faking normal” but at some point the mask will begin to slip.

That there are different types of autism spectrum disorders (or as I prefer to call it different “colour palettes” of autism) does not mean that everyone on the planet sits somewhere along a linear scale ranging from “not autistic” to “extremely autistic”. It’s much more complicated than that.

Firstly, the autism spectrum is used to describe the variety of autistic experiences, not the experiences of neurotypicals who have a few autistic traits.

Secondly, It is not a linear spectrum from “mild” to “severe” autism. Every autistic person has a combination of traits that is unique to them, many of which can be equally debilitating in different ways. Functioning labels help neither the “high functioning” autistic who is presumed to be fine nor the “low functioning” autistic who is presumed incompetent.

That there are different types of autism spectrum disorders (or as I prefer to call it different “colour palettes” of autism) does not mean that everyone on the planet sits somewhere along a linear scale ranging from “not autistic” to “extremely autistic”. It’s much more complicated than that.

Firstly, the autism spectrum is used to describe the variety of autistic experiences, not the experiences of neurotypicals who have a few autistic traits.

Secondly, It is not a linear spectrum from “mild” to “severe” autism. Every autistic person has a combination of traits that is unique to them, many of which can be equally debilitating in different ways. Functioning labels help neither the “high functioning” autistic who is presumed to be fine nor the “low functioning” autistic who is presumed incompetent.

Person first language has its origins in AIDS activism and has spread throughout advocacy groups for chronic health conditions and various disabilities.

#personfirstlanguageautism #personwithautismorautisticperson #neurodiversity",Por que muitas pessoas autistas não gostam da linguagem da pessoa primeiro,"Você já se perguntou se é melhor dizer ""pessoa com autismo ou pessoa autista""? Hoje estou dando minha opinião pessoal sobre o assunto (com a expectativa absoluta de que outras pessoas autistas discordarão de mim, natch).

A primeira língua da pessoa tem suas origens no ativismo contra a Aids e se espalhou por grupos de defesa de doenças crônicas e várias deficiências.

A primeira língua da pessoa para o autismo veio principalmente de organizações e pais do autismo, e não da própria comunidade autista. O autismo, por definição de ser um distúrbio da infância / desenvolvimento, tem a posição única de ter pais (possivelmente neurotípicos) jogados na mistura. Isso leva muitos a se tornarem ""porta-vozes"" de seus filhos, mas me pergunto se eles estão projetando seus preconceitos pessoais sobre o autismo na identidade que seus filhos têm.

Sinta-se livre para discordar de mim, mas vamos mantê-lo civilizado nos comentários, por favor!

I dag udtrykker jeg min personlige holdning til sagen (med den klare forventning, at andre autister vil være helt uenige, naturligvis).

Mennesket-først-sprogbrugen stammer fra AIDS-aktivismen og har bredt sig til andre fortaler-grupper for kroniske helbredstilstande og visse handicaps.

Mennesket-først-sprogbrugen omkring autisme kommer især fra organisationer og autisme-forældre (forældre til børn med autisme) og ikke fra de berørte selv. Autisme, der pr. definition er en tilstand, som man er født med, har altså den særstilling, at (måske neurotypiske) forældre er med i ligningen. Det fører til, at mange af dem fungerer som ""talspersoner"" for deres børn, men jeg overvejer, om ikke de overfører deres egne fordomme om autisme på deres barns identitet.

#autismingirls #actuallyautistic #autism",여성들에게서 나타나는 자폐증상들,"여성들에게서 나타나는 자폐증상들

여자아이들에게서 나타나는 자폐 증상은 매체에서 다루어지는 '전형적인 자폐의 양상'과는 상당히 다를 수 있습니다(10년 전, 제가 심리학을 전공하면서 배웠던 내용도 그랬고요).

여성들의 자폐는 나중 시기에 발견될 확률이 더욱 높지만, 우리는 자폐스펙트럼에 있는 남성들이 겪는 만큼 어려움을 겪으며 진단받지 못한 채로 삶을 살아가는 것은 우리의 정신건강에 치명적일 수 있습니다.

이 영상엔 다음 정보가 포함되어있습니다:
-상동행동
-사회성과 의사소통
-집행기능
-제한된 관심사
-감각문제
-공병률이 높은/오인될 수 있는 다른 정신건강문제

저는 아래의 invisible i님의 영상을 보고 제게 자폐문제가 있을 지도 모른다는 생각을 했습니다:

Autism symptoms in GIRLS

Autism symptoms in girls can be quite different from the stereotypical presentation we see in the media (and which was taught to me as a Psychology undergraduate 10 years ago).

Autism in women is far more likely to be diagnosed later in life, but we still struggle just as much as men on the spectrum, and struggling through when undiagnosed can be very detrimental to our mental health.

Watch this video for more information on:
- Stims
- Social skills/communication
- Executive functioning
- Special interests
- Sensory issues
- Co-morbid/ misdiagnosed mental health conditions

Video from invisible i which first made me think I might be autistic: https://youtu.be/5wKb5TUX49U

I thought it would be a fun idea for a video to look back at a randomly selected diary from my teenage years (when I was living with undiagnosed autism, among other things) and see if I could detect any signs of autism that were missed back then.

Oh boy, there were plenty! I kept diaries from about the age of 11, and believe me, the video would have been a LOT longer had I included everything! Growing up with undiagnosed autism clearly took its toll on my mental health at the time, and although I am much happier today, my wish is that no one else ever has to go through what I did.

Trigger warning: frank discussion of teenage mental health, suicidal thoughts, disordered eating, and more.

Making this video was actually quite hard - to film and to edit, but I found it rather therapeutic in the end, to release all the pain that 16 year old Sam had bottled up inside.

What I didn't expect was that it often felt like I was reading the diary of a completely different person (which was a relief I suppose!) and instead of cringing at myself, I just felt compassion for the person I used to be.

An important part of autistic advocacy is sharing our experiences, especially so that undiagnosed autistic people can pursue a diagnosis (if they feel that would be helpful).

My experiences at uni were definitely not what I expected, and this part of my life with undiagnosed autism was particularly tough for a variety of reasons.

Many autistic women I have spoken to have agreed that we have often been perceived to be two-faced or even manipulative. For us, this can be totally baffling when our intention was never to offend anyone, let alone end friendships over a misunderstanding.

In today’s video I explore why I think that is, the concept of autistic masking, people pleasing, and how we can encourage greater communication between autistic and non-autistic people.

Las personas autistas pueden verse doble cara cuando hacen aquello que se conose como ""masking"" autista.

Para alcances más profundos sobre el tema, puedes leer mi artículo para The Aspergian:  https://theaspergian.com/2019/05/20/why-autistic-women-seem-two-faced/

Muchas mujeres autistas con las que he hablado concuerdan en que a menudo han sido percibidas por los demás como ""doble cara"" o incluso como ""manipuladoras"". Para nosotras, esto puede resultar desconcertante, puesto que nuestra intención nunca ha sido ofender a nadie, mucho menos a nuestras amistades mediante un malentendido. 

En el vídeo de hoy exploraré por qué creo que sucede esto, el concepto del masking, el complacer a la gente, y como alentar una mejor comunicación entre personas autistas y no-autistas.

We are already “aware” of autism - what autistic people need from society is more widespread education about our neurological differences, and willingness from the neurotypical majority to accommodate us in situations they may never have considered before as “unfriendly” to autistic people.
 
No amount of fundraising, puzzle piece t-shirts or baking blue cupcakes is going to change the fact that we live in a world designed at almost every turn to accommodate neurotypicals, with very little thought to improving the lives of actually autistic people, especially autistic adults.

Quitting social media gave me the chance to clear my head, and meditate on my life.

All that mental chatter that had built up as I was bombarded by news articles, photos of this and that, knowledge of what that person I met that one time had for lunch today… that eventually disappeared and allowed me to live my life in a more mindful way.

Facebook is much harder to quit for good, but I'm taking it one day at a time. I do believe we get addicted to the little rushes of dopamine that Facebook provides us with, but I am learning that the longer I'm away from it, the less attractive it is.
