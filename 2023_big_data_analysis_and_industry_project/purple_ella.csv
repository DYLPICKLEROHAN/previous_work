I visited The Algarve with my family, I have autism, ADHD and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and have three neurodivergent children.

 Travel has been difficult for us in the past, but with careful planning and support we had an amazing holiday. 

I hope you enjoy my vlog.

In this video I'm sharing my experiences, and the strategies and techniques I'm using to prevent this issue

Communication is a really important part of a happy romantic relationship. Communicating love can be expressed differently for different people. 

It has come to my attention that the creator of the five love languages has made homophonic statements and as such I will not share a link to the quiz and would encourage you to not use the quiz. Instead perhaps you could reflect on how you enjoy giving and receiving love ‚ò∫Ô∏è 

I was unaware of this when I made the video.

I'm talking to Samantha Stein about how autistic traits can be interpreted in terms of actual behaviours. Including stimming and special interests 

 As well as aspects of autistic processing which are internal (so not seen) but form part of the autistic experience.

After realising that I am masking in front of my husband I started thinking about the reality for many late diagnosed autistic people who were in a relationship before getting diagnosed. Or any long term relationships (friendships, work colleagues etc)  we had before getting diagnosed and now need to address unmasking autism in that context. 

It can be hard to unmask with someone who is already supposed to know us really well. Where do we begin the unmasking process in our own homes. 

In this video my husband and I are talking about that process for us as a couple in hopes that what we address might be useful for other people.

My daughter has known she is autistic since she was seven, and has grown up in a neurodivergent house where we try to accommodate each others needs without judgement. 

I chatted to her about:
- how autism impacts her life as a 16 year old.
- what she loves (passions), and how she approaches engaging with the things she loves.
- what she learned about autistic wellness and how she will apply it to her life as she starts to become more independent.
- her experiences of starting to advocate and ask for accommodations for herself.
- scheduling! does she share my love of it?

I'm talking through the DSM 5 criteria for an autism diagnosis. 

This will be a useful video if you're:
- Considering whether you might be autistic
- The carer or parent of a child who might be autistic
- Wanting to learn more about autism generally
- An autistic person wanting to know where the diagnostic criteria applies to them. 

Some online autism quizzes (these are not diagnostic tools but useful when you're exploring the possibility of autism):

The Aspie Quiz - https://embrace-autism.com/aspie-quiz/
The AQ test - https://embrace-autism.com/autism-spectrum-quotient/

I'll be joined by channel regulars Ros and Cathie in this epic gingerbread house decorating challenge. Who can decorate the best gingerbread house? 

This is a fundraising livestream for a charity very close to my heart. Dogs for Autism provide trained autism assistance dogs for autistic people of all ages. There is no pressure to donate, you can just come for the festive fun, but if you have a little spare then I'd really appreciate your donations. 

I'll also be joined by Dogs for Autism's CEO and expert trainer Hilary Armour via video chat to tell us a little bit about the great work that they do.

 I'm discussing the differences between gender identity, biological sex and gender expression. 

As well as how gender identity experiences may differ for autistic people(including info about autigender) and research about increased likelyhood of autism in gender diverse people.

I finish by talking about my own journey exploring my gender identity.

There's an issue around identifying, diagnosing and supporting autistic women and girls. But the answer to this issue appears to be labelling a particular presentation of autism as 'girl autism' with associated lists of girl autism symptoms being shared online. 

I feel that this way of tackling the issue excludes anyone who doesn't identify as female but who's autism presents in this way. So I made this video as part of a collaboration with fellow autistic YouTuber Yo Samdy Sam to talk about my concerns.

Is it worth getting an autism or ADHD diagnosis (or both)? It can be really difficult and time consuming to get assessed for autism or ADHD and in this video I'm discussing those challenges and whether ultimately it's worth the effort required to get assessed and diagnosed.

A little bit about me: 
Hi I'm Purple Ella and my family is an autism family with three out of five of us on the autistic spectrum. I also have a connective tissue disorder (hypermobile Ehlers-danlos syndrome). So life can be a challenge but also a lot of fun.

A little bit about me: 
Hi I'm Purple Ella and my family is an autism family with three out of five of us on the autistic spectrum. I also have a connective tissue disorder (hypermobile Ehlers-danlos syndrome). So life can be a challenge but also a lot of fun.

A little bit about me:
