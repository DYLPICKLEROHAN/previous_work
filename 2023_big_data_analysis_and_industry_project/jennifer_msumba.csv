After my last video, my placement ""grounded"" me for three weeks. Basically I could not leave the property. I could go outside but not to my play or church or any outside activities. I was DEVASTATED. But then, something came in my head to get a small drum kit. So, against my better judgement I spent my last money on a Kickboxx suitcase drum set. It came in a few days and....my life was changed. Playing the drums is such a good outlet for me. It is physical yet musical and I can just play from my heart whatever rhythms I feel. I was so in love and obsessed that I decided to sell the first kit, along with some other items to get a real proper kit. This is that video. So, what was meant to bring me down, those 3 weeks, ended up being a blessing. I am now the proud owner of a set of vintage Premier birch wood drums. Thank you to everyone who left such kind, caring and understanding messages. I read them all. I know so many people were praying for me. I made it through and you helped me. Thank you. 
If you are looking to learn the drums, I highly recommend this channel: @RobBeatdownBrown

The Enchanted Bookshop (Part 2)","I feel pretty vulnerable whenever I have to where a uniform or costume that I did not pick out. I worry it will fit me, or have itchy materials, or look a way that I don't want to look. So I knew this was going to be difficult, but...I didn't know it would make me feel this bad. I didn't really show it in my face, but this was hard. Thankfully I know that my worth is not in how I look in a dress, but is in Jesus. I feel better today and I am ready to share part 2 of my theater experience!! #theenchantedbookshop

After watching dozens of @HairyTornado videos about these stores, they opened one up right here! I also won the raffle, which blew my mind because I never win raffles lol. What a day!! Come along for the ride.

There was a lot of chaos in there, and unspoken rules, but she filled me in and helped me out. I had to handle a lot of noise and learn to be assertive...because people WILL push you out of the way. In the end I got so much for just $14!  Not all of it was retro but I got a lot of cool toys and electronics. Plus I had fun and can say I survived the Goodwill bins lol, which really should be a t-shirt. Shout out to @HairyTornado for teaching me how to be a better deal hunter. If you enjoy thrifting I think you would love his channel.

Pre-Order here: https://amzn.to/3k48uqk
Learn more about the author: https://www.jennifermsumba.com/

“I have lived through some horrible experiences, all in the name of treatment. But there was one thing I never let those people steal from me, and that was my spirit.”

Shouting At Leaves takes the reader on the journey of its autistic writer from toddlerhood to adulthood. With humor and grace, this book walks you through the mind and experiences of Jennifer as she navigates the world of family, friendships and school life. It places you with her as she is confined in the mental health system, and you will cheer her on as she not only survives but takes on a new life of freedom and joy in the end. She shares stories, tips, and strategies to equip you to be your own champion, and to build around you people who are loyal and true.

Today on Now, That's Interesting! I interview friend and fellow filmmaker Scott Klumb. Scott was diagnosed with autism later in life, and in this interview we talk about how that effects a person who is on the spectrum and how it affected him, both good and bad.

Scott was also a winner in the @TheDisabilityFilmChallenge last year (Best Editor) and he has a new documentary, Autism: One Man's Journey, releasing for free on April 8, 2021. 

You can watch the trailer here: https://youtu.be/NrGjyehkztU

No worries let's go to the beach!,"Even though I live close, I haven't been to the beach in over a year because of, well, you know...2020. So I made plans with my friends to go, but then a tropical storm was supposed to hit that same weekend. We decided to go anyways and try to get in some nice times and fishing before the storm. It seems like this year you just have to find all of the little moments you can and make the best of it.

Lyrics to Finally Home:
five years old, dirt under my nails
throwing rocks at the bullies
saying you’re not a girl
scared of my own shadow I
was in my own world

longing 
to be free from the trap in my mind
where the black hole of circles
distorted the time
but I fought with a champions heart
determined to shine

days burn
years pass
they say it gets worse before better
found my
own path
i wish I had seen this letter

you will be strong
you will be loved
you will be, a person whose people
are loyal and true

don’t be scared Love
don’t hide your face, in your hands
look to the sun
it’s where you belong
keep moving on

all grown up now
life’s looking good
got a place of my own
i’m where I belong
i’m finally home

now I am strong
and I am loved
i am the person, whose circle of people
are loyal and true

i’m not afraid now
got my face towards the sun
i’m where I belong 
i’m happy and strong
i’m finally home

Because He Lives:
God sent His son, they called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my savior lives

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives


And then one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then, as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He reigns

Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives

Lyrics:
We weren't meant
To carry all this weight
We weren't meant
To harbor fear and worry
We were made
In the image of our Father
So we'll rejoice
In all that He has made

He is Truth
He is Love
He is Protection
So bring
Your burdens
To Him

Oh God, watch over us
Oh God, soothe our hearts
Oh Father, bring peace to us
Oh God, watch over us
Oh Father, heal our hearts
Oh Father, heal our land
Oh Father...

We weren't meant
To carry all this weight
We weren't meant
To harbor fear and worry
We were made
In the image of our Father
Let us rejoice
In all that He has made

Let us remember
That You are in control
Let us remember
The world is in Your hands

Oh God, watch over us

When I got the news this morning I was REALLY upset. But then after talking to some friends, I realized I can take this opportunity to rest and also make content to help us get through this time. I decided I will make a daily vlog for this time and just keep you up to date on how I'm handling all the changes as well as it's a chance for us to encourage each other. We are going to make lemonade out of lemons! My porch swing: https://amzn.to/2U2P5aV (Affiliate)

Here In The Presence by Elevation Worship lyrics:
Here I lay my burdens down
Lose my worries in Your love
Casting every care on You
I have carried them enough
We're not alone
Here within His love
Emmanuel
He is still with us
When the world becomes too much
Near the cross I will remain
Until every fear is stilled
At the mention of Your name
We're not alone
Here within His love
Emmanuel
He is still with us
We're not alone
Here within His love
Emmanuel
He is still with us
Mercy is falling, falling
Lift up your hands receive it now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Mercy is falling, falling
Lift up your hands receive it now
Here in the presence of the Lord
I know your past is broken
You can move on it's over now
Here in the presence of the Lord
I know your past is broken
You can move on it's over now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Tired of running, running
Be still and know He's in control
Here in the presence of the Lord
Pour out your heart before Him
Open your arms He'll hold you now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Pour out your heart before Him
Open your arms He'll hold you now
Here in the presence of the Lord!
Mercy is falling, falling
Lift up your hands receive it now
You're in the presence of the Lord
Mercy is falling, falling
Lift up your hands receive it now
You're in the presence of the Lord

So here is a peek at what goes on in Asa's mind, let's get to know him a little better!

I spent this past weekend with my great friends in the #AutismVlogSquad at Playlist Live in Orlando, Florida. But first Lindsey and I went to Universal Studios for some theme park fun! All I can say is that it was an amazingly incredible experience to spend so much time with @FatheringAutism @potspanspriscilla @Kaitlin_and_Kaidale @LaurenBrazee @SummerMagliochetti Isaiah, Becca, and of course sweet Abbie. We really got to know each other better and share in a wonderful experience.

This past week I had some amazing experiences! First, I was part of the #AutismVlogSquad meetup in Orlando along with @FatheringAutism @TheWeeFamily @LaurenBrazee and @Kaitlin_and_Kaidale. I have never done a meetup before, and it was so fun. Everyone was so kind and happy to be there. I couldn't believe I was getting to meet the people who watch my videos! Then the next day our crew took over Magic Kingdom at Disney World and it was magical! I had so much fun as did everyone else. Thank you so much to my friends for inviting me and making me a part of the squad

Super Fantastic Autism Show,"Episode 3-  I'm very excited because today's episode has some new surprise segments, so make sure to stay tuned until the end. It's been an epic week. I have always been afraid to drive because of the multi-tasking involved. I don't know if it's because I have autism, but there are just too many things to pay attention to at one time like the road, the signs and lights, pedestrians, other cars, gas, brake etc. I have never been able to drive because of this. But this week, I sort of had a modified driving experience...and it was fantastic! #superfantasticautismshow #autism

My name is Jennifer Msumba, also known as Rebranding Autism. Besides YouTube, I also make short films and documentaries. Eyes On Me is a project that is close to my heart. It is eventually going to be a feature film about YouTube's autistic creators. There are so many wonderful autistic creators out there who are working hard to succeed on this platform, and I want to tell their stories. Here is our first trailer. You may recognize some faces! I want to thank Stephany Bethany, IndieAndy, Frankie MacDonald, The Aspie World, PhantomStrider and TeamAutismpedia for sharing their stories. I will link their channels below. More to come! 
***If you are an autistic creator or know someone who may like to participate, leave me a comment. I would also like to know your thoughts on this topic and if you would even be interested in watching a feature film about it.

We went out on the water with Captain Rachel and she was amazing to fish with. I was a little nervous to be on the boat in the beginning but then I relaxed. It was another new experience for me.

I sang a mash up of two of my favorite songs- I Held On and No Longer Slaves, two songs which really describe my life in dealing with autism and anxiety. I was nervous in the beginning but as soon as I started to play the piano and sing, My nerves calmed down and I felt even and right. Music makes me feel that way- like my body is finally even and right in space, if that makes any sense.

You see, I had an idea for a video collaboration with them so I contacted the owner Jenny and asked if we could meet and discuss the possibility. I can't believe I did that on my own! She agreed and so we sat down and I presented my ideas to her. She liked my idea and we expanded on it. So stay tuned for the final production. I encourage you, if you have autism or ADHD or anxiety, not to underestimate yourself and reach for your goals, you can handle much more then you think you can

gotta have a drink to get the cobwebs out my head

with my hair a total mess
i fumble with with my mug 
a clumsy game of chess, mate

I pop inside a K cup and 
i take myself a seat
cause half and half and honey 
makes that bitter beverage sweet   

Sometimes this is the only thing that gets me out of bed
its coffee its coffee its how i stay ahead
when i don’t want to wake up and I’m pushing snooze instead
its coffee its coffee its how i clear my head

Chicka chicka cha ding ya
now my coffee’s done
i take that brew and pour it
top it off with cinnamon

i take a sip and damn 
now i’m feeling kind of good
cause coffee is my drink yeah
