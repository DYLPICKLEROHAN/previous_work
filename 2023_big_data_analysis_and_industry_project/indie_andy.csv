But also the talk about why you should not stop stimming! If you want to understand autistic stimming better, check out the playlist below:

👉 Autism Stimming Playlist: https://bit.ly/3pJQmkW

What is autistic stimming?
Stimming is a shortened term of self-stimulatory behavior and stimming is repetitive actions that a person does to self regulate, to block out stimulus or to relieve anxiety or to express emotion in a physical way. This can include movement of the body or body parts or the way you handle objects.  If this is done in a repeating pattern, then this is stimming.

👉 Autism Stimming Playlist: https://bit.ly/3pJQmkW

What is autistic stimming?
Stimming is a shortened term of self-stimulatory behavior and stimming is repetitive actions that a person does to self regulate, to block out stimulus or to relieve anxiety or to express emotion in a physical way. This can include movement of the body or body parts or the way you handle objects.  If this is done in a repeating pattern, then this is stimming.

With World Autism Awareness Week 2021 falling in April, it got me thinking about the general public and how to support autistic people throughout the course of the year, not just during world autism awareness month. So with this in mind, I came up with a few ideas on how to support autistic people in general but for loved ones.

Are their ways on how to help an autistic person after autism awareness month 2021? Please let me know down below!

Well in this first World Autism Awareness Week 2021 video, I put some questions to you which relate to the experiences of autistic people to see if you resonate to them. Often people have stereotyped idea about what autism is so I thought that this video might help those understand autism and to see if you could have undiagnosed autism.

But autism burnout symptoms for those who do not know is a state of physical and mental exhaustion caused by heightened stress usually occurring from life transitions or prolonged amounts of stress. Autistic Burnout can happen at any age of an autistic person's life and can impact a person's executive functioning and more.

Depression is a mental health issue where a person feels sad or feeling down for extensive periods of time which can affect autistic people also. For more information, use my references below.

But Autienelle and I talked about autism portrayals in media, and what autistic people would like to see in media to showcase real autism representation in the media.

*ABOUT ME*
Hello indie people, I'm Andy and I have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I make videos on autism from the perspective of an autistic adult. Sharing my autism experiences to help other autistic people and autism families to improve their understanding of autism.

This channel is focused on raising autism awareness & acceptance of autism. To try and change attitudes towards autism, to educate people about autism for those who are new to the autism world.

So if you are on the spectrum, know someone with autism, or are working professionally in the autism field and want to learn more about autistic people then consider subscribing and turning on the notification bell to see all future videos.

(Autistic Masking),"Hi indie people! Autistic masking is an ever-growing topic for autistic people in 2021. But the question should autistic people take off the mask is a difficult one to answer. So I wanted to share with you what is autistic masking but also whether autistic people should take off the mask and stop autism masking?

Autistic Masking is a trait of autism where autistic people hide their autism from other people in order to be accepted. Autistic masking is also known as Camouflaging or autistic camouflaging. This is where autistic people mask in order to come across as more ""normal"" or neurotypical. Autistic masking is referenced more with autistic females but autistic males can mask also. But should autistic people take off the mask?

So I was delighted to chat with @YoSamdySam about her experiences in parenting as an autistic mother. Giving her autistic parenting advice but also giving her real thoughts on parenting which I really appreciated her sharing. But Sam is a widely popular autistic YouTuber with over 50,000 subscribers so as a fan of her work, I asked questions about how she feels about YouTube from her point of view as an autistic content creator.

So I was delighted to chat with @YoSamdySam about her experiences in parenting as an autistic mother. Giving her autistic parenting advice but also giving her real thoughts on parenting which I really appreciated her sharing. But Sam is a widely popular autistic YouTuber with over 50,000 subscribers so as a fan of her work, I asked questions about how she feels about YouTube from her point of view as an autistic content creator.

Massive thank you to Sam for coming onto the podcast and be sure to check out her on:

But remember that autism self care isn't just physical or mental self care but rather trying to give autistic people self care skills to help their autism.

Issues with autistic self care can come about because of executive functioning issues and autism burnout. But self-care is so important for our own mental health.

Anxiety can be comorbidity with autism and it’s something which is quite common when it comes to autism and anxiety in adults. Whether it's autism and generalized anxiety disorder (Persistent worry about multiple things), or autism and social anxiety disorder (the fear of meeting or speaking to people), these can be comorbid with autism spectrum disorder.

Anxiety is the feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe.  Now anxiety is something we all experience from time to time and it is a normal feeling to experience especially for certain things i.e. taking a test, going for a doctor's appointment.  But too much anxiety can be really unhealthy & can affect daily life in multiple ways.

Well in this video, I talk about what is an autism meltdown, what is a temper tantrum, and some ways to help stop an autism meltdown.

Do you have autistic meltdowns?  I have experienced both and they make me feel unable to do things. But it's important to recognize your autism meltdown symptoms or the autism meltdown triggers in your young person to help stop autistic meltdowns.

What is autism stimming?
Stimming is a shortened term of self-stimulatory behavior and stimming is repetitive actions that a person does to self regulate, to block out stimulus or to relieve anxiety or to express emotion in a physical way. This can include movement of the body or body parts or the way you handle objects.  If this is done in a repeating pattern, then this is stimming.

The difference between autistic stimming and neurotypical stimming?
Whether you are autistic and neurotypical, everybody stims but often between autistic stimming and neurotypical stimming is the type of stimming but also the amount. Autistics tend to stim alot more and are less restrictive on how they are stimming.

Different types of autism stimming examples:
Verbal stimming
Visual stimming
Tactile stimming
Oral stimming
Auditory stimming
Olfactory stimming
Vestibular stimming
Proprioception stimming

Is Stimming dangerous for autistic people?
For the most part, stimming is in no way dangerous for autistic people. But that is not to say that there are no stims which can be dangerous for autistic individuals.  These are stims which are known as self-injurious behaviors i,e. hand banging, hand biting, excessive skin rubbing and scratching as just a few examples. But when someone is doing this it’s important to find out what the cause of the stims is.  Because it could be an easy solution fixable. But also it’s important to understand that stimming in the eyes of many autistics stimming allows me to be able to express ourselves, to self-regulate etc.

Stimming or self-stimulatory behaviour by definition can be a repetitive autism behaviour for autistic people to feel stimulated. Either because they are understimulated (hyposensitive) or overstimulated (hypersensitive). These autism stimming examples are very broad examples of stimming behaviours that an autistic person may exhibit. Stimming is not exclusive to autism as can be shown in other neurodiverse people as well as neurotypicals/non-autistics.

In this video, I show off different types of autism stimming in the 5 types of stimming: Auditory stimming, tactile stimming, visual stimming, olfactory stimming and vestibular stimming. But I have broken these down into individual autistic stimming examples such as hand flapping, rocking and more.

The 5 autism stim examples shown in this video: 
Auditory stimming / verbal stimming - 0:33
Tactile stimming - 1:14
Visual stimming - 1:48
Olfactory stimming - 2:32
Vestibular stimming - 3:00

But if being autistic does affect making friends, I wanted to share some friendship tips for those on the autism spectrum. To hopefully help you how to make friends and also maintain friendships.

🙆🙆‍♂️Similar video (How To Tell Your Friends Your Autistic?): https://youtu.be/kArV-wjL4Ak

Overall, I have made a few close friends despite being autistic. The major difficulty I find is just maintaining friends because yes I love seeing my friends. But maintaining friends can take a toll on me socially. I am very lucky to be people's autistic best friend but just talking to friends online for me just isn’t the same as real life. I find it tricky to keep friendships going if I am not with them or see them when I can.

In this video, I wanted to talk about some of the positive autistic traits in autistic people. Because often autism is talked about in a negative way but being autistic can be a positive which is what I want to showcase through these 5 positive autism traits.

Learn the signs of autism burnout:
If you feeling more tired, fatigued, eating more sugary treats or caffeinated drinks to be alert, this could be an early sign of autism burnout. But also like I say, having issues with executive functions could be a sign of autistic burnout (To learn more about executive dysfunction, check out this link: https://youtu.be/wc2tWdI_-qk )

Knowing your limits:
One way to prevent autism burnout & ultimately help you coping witht autism burnout is by understanding your own limitations, knowing to stop taking you more tasks or commitment can help you avoid burnout. We can all sometimes forget what our limits are if we are pushing to be successful in what we are doing. But knowing your limits and stepping limits can help prevent autistic burnout from happening.

Try not to over do it:
We can all take on far too much and push ourselves to the limit when we know we can't handle it. This can be to try and prove to others that we are capable however by taking on more tha what we can handle can lead to autistics to becoming burnt out.

Sensory issues due to signs of autistic burnout:
If you experiencing symptoms of burnout and your sensory issues become worse because of autism burnout, it's important to make sure that you are looking after themselves more than ever. Whether this is by wearing sunglasses to minimise the sensory input from lighting etc (For autistic life hacks which could help, check out this video: https://youtu.be/n1gajHcMLn8 )

Taking breaks:
By taking regular breaks from your work or life can greatly reduce the risk of autism burnout from happening. Because the more we push past our limits and over do it, the better likely we as autistic people will feel autistic burnout.  

Asking for help when you're struggling:
I know that this is easier said than done. But I've been in autistic burnout before and thought that I would just ""get over it"" or think that I was something wrong with me. However as nasty as burnout is, it's not your fault. It's your bodies way of saying that you are doing too much and people will have experiences of burnout regardless of whether it's autism burnout etc. So reaching out to people can help and also a problem sahred is a problem halved as they say.

In this video, we will be looking at whether autism spectrum disorder really does define autistic people. Because autistic people say that autism doesn't define them however I wanted to explore whether this was true for myself. 

Autism as a label can be difficult for some, how other autistic people embrace it.  But for those who embrace their autistic identify, does autism define them and who they are?

So does autism define you as an autistic person?

What is executive functioning? Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes that are necessary for the control of behaviours. Which include selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that allow you to achieve goals but also allow you plan and organise these goals. This is done by being able to shift between tasks and multitasking. However executive dysfunction is the difficulty in being able to perform these executive functions which affects people with autism, ADHD, learning disabilites as well as brain injuries and strokes.

What is executive functioning? Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes that are necessary for the control of behaviours. Which include selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that allow you to achieve goals but also allow you plan and organise these goals. This is done by being able to shift between tasks and multitasking. However executive dysfunction is the difficulty in being able to perform these executive functions which affects people with autism, ADHD, learning disabilites as well as brain injuries and strokes.

What does autism look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrWK8uWgCF4&t=7s

What is autism spectrum disorder? Autism is a neurological condition which we percieve the world as a whole. Some autistic people have difficulty in social communication, some autistics rely on autistic masking, some have other preferences or ways of coping with the world. The characterstics of autism are endless which makes the question of what is autism truly about hard as it is difference for everyone involved. But I hope that by talking about autism, we can get a great understading of what is it like to have autism

For me as an autistic person, I believe that there are issues with the autism community and autistic community as a whole which makes it harder and harder for me to be involved with it. So I wanted to hear my worries about the autism community with you.

What are your thoughts on the autism community? Let me know!

Disclaimer - The autism community isn't all bad all of the time but I do feel that things could be better.

Stimming or self-stimulatory behaviour by definition can be a repetitive autism behaviour for autistic people which involves repetitive movements or sounds. Autistic people of all ages stim, autistic kids stim, autistic adults stim to some degree.

Examples of stimming include biting fingernails, hair twirling, cracking knuckles, drumming your fingers, whistling. Autism stimming is typically more repetitive and noticeable in comparison with rocking, autistic flap hands, bouncing, jumping, walking on tiptoes, repetitive blinking, rearranging objects as some autistic stimming examples.

These types of autism stimming are a fraction of the different autistic stims that there are out there but stimming in its nature is a way for autistic people to self-sooth when feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated (hypersensitive). Sometimes it's to create sensory stimulus due to being understimulated (hyposensitive). Stimming could be due to sensory issues so autistic people might stim due to it being a stimming behavior.

These are really broad explanations to why autistic people have stimming behaviours. Stimming is not exclusive to autism as it appears in those with ADHD, Aspergers, anxiety etc as well as neurotypicals/non-autistics.

DISCLAIMER: This alexithymia test is only to be used as a guide only and doesn't imply that I may have Alexithymia. Also please be mindful that ANY online tests could generate inaccurate results. If you are concerned or have questions, please seek medical advice from a medical professional.

Because of my autism, I do find understanding emotions whether it's my own or others tricky as well as other interpersonal skills. Due to this, the topic of alexithymia has been playing on my mind a lot recently hence why I did this alexithymia quiz.

What Is Alexithymia?
Alexithymia is a personality construct that describes a person who has difficulty in recognising or naming your own emotions. This comes from the greek to mean ""no words for emotions"" and it's estimated that 10% of the general population experience alexithymia traits. 

It is also estimated that alexithymia is more common in autistic people due to the difficulty in recognising and understanding emotions. But by being understanding to people who experience alexithymia & trying to keep in touch with your feelings can help with your alexithymic traits.

Now autism special interests are a massive part of being on the autism spectrum. The idea of wanting to know everything about a specific topic or the need to collect things can appear to be weird and obsessive.

After a very overwhelming weekend, I decided to open about why being autism can suck for me personally. But also to say that if you feel that your autism sucks that it's ok to open up about that.

Autism can present many challenges for many autistics. For me, it's more focused on social communication, executive functioning and generally the way society can make being autistic hard. But without my autism, I wouldn't be who I am and I wouldn't have the people in my life that I do without it. Being autistic can suck but it's something that I'm grateful at the same time despite how challenging autism can be.

Disclaimer: This is just my opinion from my experience as an autistic person. I do not say for all autistics and it doesn't fair to make comparisons between autistic people. So please be respectful and considerate.

I've done a few of these top autism memes ever videos before but this is one was my favourite. Not only do we look into autistic masking in this autistic meme review. But it's the first time I've asked an autistic meme page to use their memes for a video. Hopefully, more videos in 2020 featuring memes will include other meme creators.

Alexithymia describes a person who has difficulty in recognising or naming your own emotions. This comes from the greek to mean ""no words for emotions"" and it's estimated that 10% of the general population experiences alexithymia traits. 

It is also estimated that alexithymia is more common in autistic people due to the difficulty in recognising and understanding emotions. But by being understanding to people who experience alexithymia & trying to get in touch with your emotions is important to help maintain friendships and relationships.

In this video, I share my own experience on how I became open about my autism over time in an effort that we can talk about autism in a way that's more accepting but also help other autistic people talk about their autism more openly. In a way, my own life experiences helped me with how to feel comfortable with autism generally and my own autism diagnosis. 

Now I feel that by being open about my autism, it helps other autistic people, the general public etc. Which help raise autism awareness but promotes autism acceptance which is achieved when autistic people are open about their autism.

Autism is a neurological condition that can impact the way autistic people communicate, interact with the world and understand it. But what does autism look like? What is it like to be on the autism spectrum? What does being autistic look like from my own perspective?  

In this special video for World Autism Awareness Day 2019, I look at what it is like to be autistic from my perspective as someone living with autism. Not just what you see on the surface but also what autistic people and autism families sometimes have to deal with from governments and people in society.

My hope with this short film is to give hope to those who are autistic that we are pushing for inclusion for all autistic people. I hope the video shows families of autistic people that yes your autism journey might be difficult but I want to show that there are good days. I want autism professionals, people who don't know the autism world to watch this video and to understand that being autistic sometimes isn't easy. But we have qualities which make us amazing and not to judge autistic people based on what you can see.  Autism is a condition which can be hidden, it is an invisible condition for some of us and this autism video I truly hope raises awareness with the ultimate goal of acceptance for all autistic people.

This video is apart of a series for World Autism Awareness Week or WAAW:

🌍World Autism Awareness Week 2019 Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU7asIuC9SU_E6MD140qnOh7n31IduIXL

Videos on autism from the perspective of an autistic adult. Sharing my autism experiences to help other autistic people and autism families to improve understanding of autism.

This channel is focused on raising autism awareness & acceptance of autism. To try and change attitudes towards autism, to educate people about autism for those who are new to the autism world.

Hi indie people! I talk about what an autism special interest is, I give some examples of special interests and how they are important for autistic people. What the difference is between an autistic person having a hobby and a special interest. But also discussing how autistic obsessions can also be linked to our special interests.

Now Special interests & autism is something I have been wanting to discuss for a long term as this is a massive part of being on the autism spectrum. The idea of wanting to know everything about a specific topic or the need to collect things can appear to be weird and obsessive. But for autistic people like myself, autism special interests are an important part of our wellbeing. This is because they provide a sense of stability in a world filled with uncertainty.

Could everyone be on the autistic spectrum? I personally think not because to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition, they would need to have some forms of difficulty in all of the main areas of autism. These areas included social communication, repetitive behaviours etc. So my advice is if you identify with any traits then go to your GP or medical professional to discuss it further. 

However, if everyone was on the spectrum, why would we need autistic advocates for example?  I feel that being on the autism spectrum is more than just a list of autism symptoms or traits. It is about how those traits impact on the person. 

But this doesn't mean that you can't try to relate to autistic people though. Instead of trying to compare or saying we are all the same, maybe say ""I can relate, I can understand or I've been through something similar"".

Could everyone be on the autistic spectrum? I personally think not because to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition, they would need to have some forms of difficulty in all of the main areas of autism. These areas included social communication, repetitive behaviours etc. So my advice is if you identify with any traits then go to your GP or medical professional to discuss it further. 

However, if everyone was on the spectrum, why would we need autistic advocates for example?  I feel that being on the autism spectrum is more than just a list of autism symptoms or traits. It is about how those traits impact on the person. 

But this doesn't mean that you can't try to relate to autistic people though. Instead of trying to compare or saying we are all the same, maybe say ""I can relate, I can understand or I've been through something similar"".

Hi indie people! In this video, Sez Francis and I shared our easy tips for businesses to help autistic customers to access their stores. Most importantly we hope some of these autistic friendly tips will help autistic employees as well.

➡️ Check out Sez's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGrCJ075UyDw-PRObU5eQw/featured

We talked about different aspects of autism friendliness which we feel business could implement. Such as autistic people can struggle with sensory issues and stores can be too loud & too bright. By making some changes, you can become an autism friendly employer and help other autistic people in the process. This is in order to autism friendly environments for organisations to be more autism friendly.

Do you have any suggestions on how businesses can be more autism friendly or are there businesses that could do more?

Often in the autism community online, I see other autistic people who had a late autism diagnosis in adulthood saying that they wished they got a diagnosed or wished they or someone realised sooner. As someone who was fortunate to get a diagnosis in childhood, I wanted to share my own reality about growing up as an autistic person in the 90s in Newcastle, UK. Not to brag about my autism diagnosis but to just highlight that even when you have the support in place etc. It doesn't mean that it is any easier.

My question is are quiet hours in general enough for autistic people to handle shopping experiences?

🛒National Autistic Society Autism Hour: http://tiny.cc/nas-autism-hour
🛒Morrison Quiet Hour Review: http://tiny.cc/quiet-hour-review

What is an Autism hour? Autism Hour is a campaign by the national autistic society for businesses to make their stores more accessible for autistic people by making adjustments i.e. reducing noise & lowering lighting. This is for 1 week in October for 1 hour per day between Saturday 5th to Saturday 12th October 2019. But also the staff get a better understanding of autism so help their autistic customers & their families by raising autism awareness. The goal is to make shopping experiences more welcoming and safer for autistic people and their families. In the UK, quiet hours are becoming more frequent which for me as an autistic person is great. 

But as I know how difficult shopping as an autistic person, I am wondering if more can be done?

🛒National Autistic Society Autism Hour: http://tiny.cc/nas-autism-hour
🛒Morrison Quiet Hour Review: http://tiny.cc/quiet-hour-review

What is an Autism hour? Autism Hour is a campaign by the national autistic society for businesses to make their stores more accessible for autistic people by making adjustments i.e. reducing noise & lowering lighting. This is for 1 week in October for 1 hour per day between Saturday 5th to Saturday 12th October 2019. But also the staff get a better understanding of autism so help their autistic customers & their families by raising autism awareness. The goal is to make shopping experiences more welcoming and safer for autistic people and their families. In the UK, quiet hours are becoming more frequent which for me as an autistic person is great. 

But as I know how difficult shopping as an autistic person, I am wondering if more can be done?

Hi indie people, In today's video, we will be discussing the topic of whether we should use condition or disorder in relation to the autism spectrum.

The term ""Autism Spectrum Disorders"" is typically used by professionals but over recent years, more people are starting to use the term ""Autism Spectrum Conditions"" especially in the autism community.

What do you think? Do you think we should be saying autism spectrum disorder or autism spectrum conditions? Join the conversation by commenting down below.

Autism meltdowns are one of the hardest autism traits for me as an autistic person. For a lot of people on the autism spectrum, meltdowns are a common autism trait. 

Meltdowns can occur regardless of age but it is mostly talked about with autistic children which could be seen as a tantrum or misbehaviour.  For some autistic adults, meltdown may come out as rage or anger but also can result in some self-injurious behaviours. 

Autism meltdown triggers can come from sensory overload, feeling overwhelmed and more. But by talking about meltdowns and ways to stop them, you may identify what triggers you have and apply these autism meltdown tips into your own life.

But I hope by talking about autism meltdowns openly and honestly, I hope to help others understand what autistic meltdowns are like and ways to stop meltdowns from happening.

So today I share my top autism travel tips that help me when travelling to new places. 

I do get anxious about travelling so by following these steps through, it definitely helps reduce my anxiety & allows me to enjoy myself in any new environment.  Travel with autism can be a challenge as some autistic people may find the idea of travelling to a new place that they don't know scary as it is an unknown. In this autism travel tips video, I go over my tips for this and more. To hopefully help with those autistic people going on holiday/vacation or even a day trip out.

Please be aware that I know not all autistic people will need all of these tips or find benefit in them.  But as an autistic adult myself, I hope that by sharing my experience that it helps other autistic adults, autistic people & their families with their travel preparations.

If you have any travel advice for autistic people or if you are an autistic adult with travel tips, please comment below.

I do get anxious about travelling so by following these steps through, it definitely helps reduce my anxiety & allows me to enjoy myself in any new environment.  Travel with autism can be a challenge as some autistic people may find the idea of travelling to a new place that they don't know scary as it is an unknown. In this autism travel tips video, I go over my tips for this and more. To hopefully help with those autistic people going on holiday/vacation or even a day trip out.

Please be aware that I know not all autistic people will need all of these tips or find benefit in them.  But as an autistic adult myself, I hope that by sharing my experience that it helps other autistic adults, autistic people & their families with their travel preparations.

If you have any travel advice for autistic people or if you are an autistic adult with travel tips, please comment below.

Stimming or self-stimulatory behaviour by definition can be a repetitive autism behaviour for autistic people to feel stimulated. Whether it's because they are understimulated (hyposensitive) or overstimulated (hypersensitive). These 5 autistic stims are just a few broad examples of behaviours that an autistic person may exhibit. Stimming is not exclusive to autism as it appears in those with ADHD, Aspergers, anxiety etc as well as neurotypicals/non-autistics.

Now I realise that these 5 autistic stims some autistic people may not do & that there are other types of stimming out there. I decided to cover 5 types of stims which the majority of autistic people show as this video is for people to identify autism stimming either for themselves/someone they know. 

The 5 autism stims I cover in the video are:
Verbal stimming
Taste/Smell stims
Oral stimming
Visual stimming
Tactile stimming

This is a storytime about a meltdown that I had at work to share my own experiences about meltdowns and to show what an autism meltdown is like for me.

An autism meltdown is where an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and they don't know how to express it in a way that is conventional. During this meltdown at work in 2017, there was not a singular trigger which caused the meltdown. There were alot of different factors which led to the meltdown in the office.

I hope that by talking about my meltdown it helps others understand why an autistic person may have an autism meltdown. But also to show people that just because people have meltdowns, it doesn't make them weak etc.

Now before making autism videos & getting involved with the autism community, I had a negative view of self-diagnosis as I didn't really understand why people would say they have autism when they don't have an ""actual autism diagnosis"". But over sometime & by listening to other autistics stories about self-diagnosing autism, I can understand why.

Disclaimer: My thoughts are my own & I always advise you seek medical advice where possible if you need more info about autism for yourself or someone you know.

Some might call it autistic regression & people have said that burnout makes people ""more autistic"". In today's video, I talk openly and honestly about my autism burnout experiences, what autistic burnout is and some tips to manage burnout.

The reality of autism burnout is very real where it leaves some autistic people feeling vulnerable, unsure of themselves & feeling depressed. These autism burnout symptoms can make daily activities, daily tasks even more challenging to cope with.  

I have experienced autism burnout a few times over the last few years and it is a trait of autism I truly dislike. Because autism burnout makes me feel very tired, less able to cope with simple tasks that I've done millions of times before. I feel more agitated which causes more meltdowns for me which is not pleasant.  

Coping with autism burnout is something I am still trying to do but I have a few tips for autistic burnout which do help me.  Give yourself time.  Don't take a lot on during burnout.  Make time for you.  Maybe look into energy accounting to help you balance out what you put your energy into.

Have you got any tips of how to handle autism burnout? Let's us all know in the comments.

Despite the positives, there are dangers to using social media that can leave people with autism vulnerable.  

Social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc give autistic people the opportunity to explore whatever their heart desires. With my autism, in particular, I have an obsessive and addictive personality and when I'm online, I feel the need to be on all of the time. It is incredibly easy for someone on the autism spectrum to become hooked to social media and forget about the real world. Now autistic people may turn to social media to cope and I've done this alot. It's extremely easy to become addicted to social media.

Some autistic people may not understand what people's intentions are & are again vulnerable to social media.  The other scary thing about these online sites is that you can pretend to be anyone online i.e. fake profiles. Which can lead some people with autism into a false sense of security as we like to see the best of others. 

Social media sometimes can become a place of bullying, victimization and harassment which I've experienced first time on social media. Autistic people are a lot more vulnerable and can be intimidating by others. The dangers of social media are very much real but I think social media use correctly in a safe way can be a great experience for autistic people.

It is truly an honour and humbling to see you gain any of value from me sharing my experiences. But as a YouTuber, as a content creator, there are challenges to talking about autism that I wanted to share with you. This is really to show you that I genuinely care about the autism community and want to talk about my autism experiences in a way that is right for me & for you watching.

Firstly, I do not try to represent all autistic person in my videos. I will give you context about different aspects of what it CAN be like being autistic as a generalisation. But when making autism videos, I firstly think about representing my side of autism. Because I can't speak of every person with autism and what they feel, see, hear etc. I try to be inclusive but it is impossible to accurately give you a view of the whole spectrum because we are all so different you know.

The second problem with making autism videos on YouTube is the idea that I don't want to be seen as someone who is autistic who just talks about autism all of the time. This is obviously all I do with this channel but that is because of the way YouTube works. Channels on YouTube grow better when they are sticking to one niche and mine is discussing autism.  Now I decided to do this because I felt good about helping others & I feel like I can be myself online which is truly amazing. So really I don't feel that autism defines me is really point here.

Another issue with autism videos for me is the idea of being an autism advocate. To me, advocacy of anything kind is important and I fully support those who are raising their voices for causes they are passionate about.  For me I am passionate about autism and wanting others to understand what it is like. But I do not feel comfortable with the title of advocate is right for me.

These are some of my problems with making autism videos but I hope that you get a better understanding of my thought process & that this is something I do love doing and care about.

It is truly an honour and humbling to see you gain any of value from me sharing my experiences. But as a YouTuber, as a content creator, there are challenges to talking about autism that I wanted to share with you. This is really to show you that I genuinely care about the autism community and want to talk about my autism experiences in a way that is right for me & for you watching.

Firstly, I do not try to represent all autistic person in my videos. I will give you context about different aspects of what it CAN be like being autistic as a generalisation. But when making autism videos, I firstly think about representing my side of autism. Because I can't speak of every person with autism and what they feel, see, hear etc. I try to be inclusive but it is impossible to accurately give you a view of the whole spectrum because we are all so different you know.

The second problem with making autism videos on YouTube is the idea that I don't want to be seen as someone who is autistic who just talks about autism all of the time. This is obviously all I do with this channel but that is because of the way YouTube works. Channels on YouTube grow better when they are sticking to one niche and mine is discussing autism.  Now I decided to do this because I felt good about helping others & I feel like I can be myself online which is truly amazing. So really I don't feel that autism defines me is really point here.

Another issue with autism videos for me is the idea of being an autism advocate. To me, advocacy of anything kind is important and I fully support those who are raising their voices for causes they are passionate about.  For me I am passionate about autism and wanting others to understand what it is like. But I do not feel comfortable with the title of advocate is right for me.

These are some of my problems with making autism videos but I hope that you get a better understanding of my thought process & that this is something I do love doing and care about.

(An Autistic Opinion),"Hi indie people. Functioning labels are a topic in the autism community which is highly contested and there are a lot of opinions about autism functioning labels. So in today's video, I talk what is high functioning autism & what is low functioning autism. What do these functioning labels mean and as an autistic person, give my opinion of these labels?

The following terms: high functioning autism and low functioning autism are terms that are still being used by professionals as an informal label when diagnosing autism spectrum disorders.  It is a way of labelling how an autistic person is able to function in society. This is not something I personally agree with because the spectrum is not a line and people who are on the spectrum stay on that line. Our ability to function will go top and down. So for me, the autism functioning labels are not helpful and can discredit autistic people.

I want to know your thoughts on the autism functioning labels, do you identify as having a functioning label or do you not like the labels?

[CC],"Being proud of your autism is something that I have to really learn over many years. But for today's video, I am joined by some amazing autistic children I met at a school during World Autism Awareness Week. They talk about why they are proud of their autism and how their autism makes them who they are. During this video, I talk about why I'm proud to be autistic.

It was a fantastic experience visiting the school and I'm lucky to bring you this video to share these kids thought of being proud to be autistic. They all did a fantastic job but what makes you proud to be autistic? What makes you proud to be you? Let's start a conversation!

*Disclaimer: As said in the video, all the children, the school and the children's parents/guardians are aware that this video is online and features their children. I asked for permission slips to be signed in keeping with safeguarding procedures. If you know any of the young people, please refrain from naming them, giving away their location or the schools location.

But for today's video, I am joined by some amazing autistic children I met at a school during World Autism Awareness Week. They talk about why they are proud of their autism and how their autism makes them who they are. During this video, I talk about why I'm proud to be autistic.

It was a fantastic experience visiting the school and I'm lucky to bring you this video to share these kids thought of being proud to be autistic. They all did a fantastic job but what makes you proud to be autistic? What makes you proud to be you? Let's start a conversation!

*Disclaimer: As said in the video, all the children, the school and the children's parents/guardians are aware that this video is online and features their children. I asked for permission slips to be signed in keeping with safeguarding procedures. If you know any of the young people, please refrain from naming them, giving away their location or the schools location.

This video is no exception to that theme as I share with you some of my favourite memes I've found online. I do this in an effort to make autism more relatable and for people to understand different aspects of autism through the internet's love of a good meme.

What is your favourite meme out of this list? Do you have an autism-related meme you want me to react to online? My social media below so message me or tag me and I'll be sure to include it!

Parenting autism I can imagine has its good days and its bad days. The discussion myself and Paul had is only one side of the story and in no way will be the same for every single autism parent.

The purpose of this autism video is to educate you to be able to see potential signs of masking and to define whether your mask.

Masking is a trait of autism where autistic people hide their autism from other people in order to be accepted. Autistic masking is also known as Camouflaging, Social Camouflaging or Passing and autistic people might mask in order to come across as more ""normal"" or neurotypical. Social masking is more common with females with autism but autistic males can mask also. Autistic people can act differently from neurotypicals which might mean we come across as strange.  Which sadly can lead to misunderstandings for autistic people. Autistics will predominantly mask in social situations in order to fit in.  But I hope by talking about my own experiences with autistic masking that it will raise awareness and add value to the conversation.

In today's video, as it is the start of World Autism Awareness Week 2019, I wanted to share 5 autism traits I love as an autistic adult. These traits of autism are apart of my autism spectrum disorder which I feel make me the person that I am today. 

When people talk about the signs of autism, they tend to speak about autism traits from a negative outlook or only see autism as a bad thing. As an autistic person, I understand that autism can be tricky. But this condition does have its benefits and I talk about autism symptoms that I love about myself which are positive.

My 5 autism traits I love:
Making up words and expressions
Natural curiosity
Black and white approach
Fixations on my special interests
Routines

In this video, I talk about my honest opinion on a community which I really enjoy being apart of... But there are flaws and things about it which worry me. I hope that from myself and the person who inspired this video to open up a conversation it might help the autism community. 

Disclaimer - A lot of what I talk about here is just from my own experiences and my own opinion.

So you've probably heard the term meltdown when it comes to autism. In today's video, I talk about what is an autistic meltdown from my perspective, why autism meltdowns happen and some tips on how you can help an autistic person going through an autistic meltdown. 

An autistic meltdown is an extreme response to overwhelming situations. An autistic person can become totally overwhelmed in situations. Resulting in a loss of behavioural and emotional control. 

Many autistic people will experience meltdowns. The public often finds it hard to tell autism meltdowns and temper tantrums apart, but they are different things. You can help by understanding autism, the person and what to do if you see someone having a meltdown.

In today's video, I talk about what is an autistic meltdown from my perspective, why autism meltdowns happen and some tips on how you can help an autistic person going through an autistic meltdown. 

An autistic meltdown is an extreme response to overwhelming situations. An autistic person can become totally overwhelmed in situations. Resulting in a loss of behavioural and emotional control. 

Many autistic people will experience meltdowns. The public often finds it hard to tell autism meltdowns and temper tantrums apart, but they are different things. You can help by understanding autism, the person and what to do if you see someone having a meltdown.

Are autism meltdown videos are bad and my thoughts on the people who film and share these videos online. The people who think it's acceptable to post these videos of vulnerable children & adults going through a meltdown or showing us self-injurious behaviour.

I will say that I understand that video do this for legitimate reasons. However it's more about consent issues and morals when it's for the world to see if that makes sense.

I will say that I understand that video do this for legitimate reasons. However it's more about consent issues and morals when it's for the world to see if that makes sense.

DISCLAIMER: This video is really my thoughts from being autistic myself. My views are my own.

Do you have a disability? How does it affect you? also do you think autism is a disability? Any and all thoughts are welcome in the comments!

Well hello indie people! When I was down in Birmingham, I finally met Caspar in real life. We wanted to sit down and film prior to the meet up. Luckily we had some time to film a couple of videos!! In this video, we talk about being transgender, transphobia and so much more!

I got alot out of this experience and I hope you do as well! Thank you Caspar for filming with me and talking openly as you did!

*DISCLAIMER* This video is really to inform others and the questions I asked might seem basic but I thought it would good for those that want to know more about transgender. 

Useful links that Caspar recommends:

Have a great day!

Well hello indie people! In today's video I had the pleasure of being joined by Connor Ward, who over the past year has become a good friend and someone that I respect greatly. He is also an autistic youtuber aswell! We openly talk about how autism-friendly is youtube for autistic viewers. Discussing the issues with YouTube that we personally face from sensory issues to the way creators advertise and how autistic can become obsessed and so much more.

We both that with this video, we can let others understand how YouTube can affect us and maybe lead to YouTube as well as creators might think about the way they use it in the future.

Have a great day!

I went to the autism show at the NEC Birmingham at the weekend. On reflection and after editing this autism vlog, I realised that despite how stressed and anxious I was. It was a really fantastic weekend meeting some of my favourite autistic youtubers who I consider my friends. I didn't know what to expect at my first autism show but I really loved the positivity, the sense of community and feeling accepted.

Thank you so much to everyone who made my weekend truly special and I hope to see you all again next year!

Well hello indie people and in my 4th video for World Autism Awareness Week 2018 I am talking about 5 things not to say to an autistic person. I've found online and in the real world that there are a few examples of where autistics have been upset by similar comments I've listed in the video. So I thought it would be a good idea to openly talk about these 5 and explain why someone may be offended or upset by the comments. Like I say in the video, this is not a rant or a dig at people, it's trying to bring awareness to people who may not anyway about the condition and to try and become more open-minded about neurodevelopmental conditions.

Well hello indie people and in my 4th video for World Autism Awareness Week 2018 I am talking about 5 things not to say to an autistic person. I've found online and in the real world that there are a few examples of where autistics have been upset by similar comments I've listed in the video. So I thought it would be a good idea to openly talk about these 5 and explain why someone may be offended or upset by the comments. Like I say in the video, this is not a rant or a dig at people, it's trying to bring awareness to people who may not anyway about the condition and to try and become more open-minded about neurodevelopmental conditions.

DISCLAIMER: This video is based on my views and opinions as a person with autistic spectrum disorder. I do not represent the whole of the autism community & I do not speak on behalf of everyone in said community. My views and opinions are mine and mine alone! 

*ABOUT ME*
Hello indie people, I'm Andy and I have autism spectrum disorder This channel is focused on raising autism awareness & acceptance of autism. To try and change attitudes towards autism, to educate people about autism for those who are new to the autism world.

I make video on autism from my perspective as an autistic adult. Sharing my autism experiences to help other autistic people and autism families to improve understanding of autism.

***New Videos Weekly: Tues & Fri***

So if you are on the spectrum, know someone with autism or are working professionally in the autism field and want to learn more about autistic people then consider subscribing and turning on the notification bell to see all future videos.

I make video on autism from my perspective as an autistic adult. Sharing my autism experiences to help other autistic people and autism families to improve understanding of autism.

***New Videos Weekly: Tues & Fri***

So if you are on the spectrum, know someone with autism or are working professionally in the autism field and want to learn more about autistic people then consider subscribing and turning on the notification bell to see all future videos.

Today's video is a Q&A session with the topic being around autism. I am very passionate about the topic as I am on the spectrum myself (PDD-NOS) and I thought that I would ask people on facebook & twitter for questions that they wanted answering. This video is part two of the Q&A which goes into diagnosis, people acting differently when knowing someone is on the spectrum and labelling. I really hope you enjoyed this video and if you did give the video a big old thumbs and subscribe for more content in the future. Hit that bell icon to be notified of when I upload new video.

I am very passionate about the topic as I am on the spectrum myself (PDD-NOS) and I thought that I would ask people on facebook & twitter for questions that they wanted answering. This video is part two of the Q&A which goes into diagnosis, people acting differently when knowing someone is on the spectrum and labelling.

So for today's video I decided to make a video about things that I find very annoying and just frustrate me. Recently I have been abit under the weather with cold/flu for the past 3-4 months and this time of year affects my mood generally...and I thought why make a video about it. I talk about sub4sub, slow walking people and much much more. I really hope you enjoy. If you like the video give it a thumbs up, that would be amazing and to be told when I make a new video you know what to do HIT THE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON! All I've got to say now is stay you, stay indie!

Have a great day!

However I wanted you guys to know because you get to know me abit better and I hope you take something away from this. 

Lastly I just wanted to say thank you to each and every one of you who have been so supportive since I declared this. It is incredibly heartwarming to know that people understand and care enough to support me. Thank you for just being you and keep being amazing!

I am trying to reach 100 subscribers by the end of the year, so if you share this video around, that would mean the world.

Have a great day!

Where I talk about topics that affect us as people as try to give some advice and just talk about my views/opinions. So this week, I am talking about that one thing that people either have alot of or not alot of...confidence. It is something that I have struggled with for various reasons and I felt that it was time to open up and discuss it.

Got any suggestions for topics I should talk about? Then leave a comment and I might pick it for next time :)

So I have hit the milestone of 25 subscribers. This happened awhile ago now but myself and my girlfriend (Nicola A.K.A. Northernworld) have not found the time to record. However that does not matter now as in this video, Nicola does my make-up. It was a weird experience and one that will haunt me for the rest of my life probably! But thank you to every single one of you who has supported me so far, you are amazing and I hope that you will stay with me on this adventure :) 

If you liked the video, give it a big old thumbs up, that would be amazing. To be told when I make a new video, you know what to do...HIT THAT SUBSCRIBE BUTTON! 

I will leave a link to part 2 of this challenge which is on Nicola's channel. Go have a look, like, comment and of course subscribe to her channel as she is such a bae! 

Have a great day!

I hope you are doing great :) This video is because another YouTuber (Kirsten Del Percio) answered my question during her Q&A.

Have a great day!
