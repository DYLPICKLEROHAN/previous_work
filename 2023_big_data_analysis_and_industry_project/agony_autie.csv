It was beautiful to see so many autistic people at the event, enjoying & dancing to the music. As a community we are too often deprived of the opportunities to connect. 

Just before I went on stage, I learnt that ASG‚Äôs founder Jaqueline had attended the Chester Autistic Pride 2018 event, where they heard my speech. She told me that they were motivated to create a community setting and at the age of 21 they have done just that. 

I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of their journey & have faith that autistic & disabled inclusive activities, will continue to be established in the years to come. 

It gives me so much hope, as I return to advocacy after 3 years away, to see all of the work being achieved by the autistic community. 

I look forward to continuing to reconnect with people who I have so sorely missed, over the coming year - let‚Äôs make it happen 2023 ‚ú®

If your child‚Äôs ECHP is being denied, if your child is out of school with no SEN placement in sight, please read up on how the local authority are legally obliged to provided education 

The SEN school & health crisis is well and truly upon us; it is a human rights issue that affects the most vulnerable members of our society. 

I encourage you to find a disability advocate to help you communicate with the local authority & will be compiling a list to signpost you to. 

I‚Äôll be creating an information video on how to advocate for educational access in the coming weeks. 

Please share this video as a resource if you found it of use

The pathology & dehumanisation of autistic, Neurodivergent & disabled peoples is frightening

To be dehumanised to this extent by the predominant neurotype is cruel & we are asking for change. 

The autistic & Neurodivergent communities have been showing up more than ever these past 5 years online‚Ä¶SHARING their perspective, sharing their experiences, their stims, the things that soothe their nervous systems & grounds their minds. 

And we‚Äôve been doing all that sharing & all that bearing of our souls to rehumanise the group of people they choose to deem ‚ÄúAutistic‚Äù. 

Yes, we are Autists‚Ä¶but YOU are not just ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù that they say you are. You are a person who functions DIFFERENTLY & who struggles as a result of ongoing & continuous ostracism. 

We are ostracised from schools, workplaces, social connections, healthcare‚Ä¶our liberties taken away from us. We are asking for change. 
Autistics are showing the f*ck up to end this needless cycle of suffering

Systemic abuse shows itself to disabled families in abundance; from our schools to healthcare, from our local authorities to the justice system‚Ä¶ autistic people & families are excluded, ostracised & mistreated. 
Parents are accused of neglect due to the needs of our disabled child. Parents are accused of not trying hard enough with their child, in place of recieving genuine & professional guidance on the struggles our children may be facing.

It is a vicious cycle fuelled by outdated understandings towards disability & because of a woeful lack of understanding towards Autism. 

Autistic & disability education & training is urgently needed & our government need to work to stop the perpetual harm their services are creating. It starts with empathy & understanding instead of shunning the blame onto families who may already be struggling. 

It starts with more SEN schools being built, it starts with disabled children being made a priority. It has to start. 

I‚Äôm begging service providers to open their eyes & to acknowledge the role their institutions have historically played towards demonising struggling disabled families

Recommended Research: ‚ÄúThe Polyvagal Theory‚Äù 

Feed your senses new experiences away from the sight of trauma, to create new neural circuitry- the process is called neurogenisis which is part of our brains Neuroplastic capabilities.

It takes time & repetition to rebuild safe experiences after trauma‚Ä¶even feeling safe in ones own body may be a task at first. When I was very ill after the initial impact I needed medication to help regulate me & I sometimes still do. so be kind to yourself 

Everyone‚Äôs journey will be different and what works for one may not for you. Find what makes you feel safe, secure, grounded. 

If that‚Äôs lying in bed because you feel safe & are exhausted- give that time to your body & mind. Over time I found myself tapping into physical movement & reclaiming my stims through crochet & dance ‚Ä¶which over the year helped me to attend yoga classes, roller skate socials & now the gym 

It was painfully slow and isolating steps at first - but I fed my brain & myself new experiences that help me ground, regulate & selfcare 

It‚Äôs so important to soothe our nervous systems regularly & steadily especially after the chaos trauma causes it. I really recommend you look at Stephen Porges ‚ÄúPolyvagal theory‚Äù üôèüíó‚òÄÔ∏è

It is not your fault; you‚Äôre doing the best you can

25,tj7PU8nfpD8,2022-04-29 09:29:52+00:00,,0,Autistic Empathy Myth,"The Autistic Empathy myth is reinforced by the current medical criteria which dominates our understanding of Autism today. The myth that autistic people cannot or do not have the capacity to neurologically experience Empathy (feelings towards other people) is categorically incorrect but still reinforced today 

it‚Äôs a presumptive myth that aims to split our divine consciousness & our internal self-subjective. You can‚Äôt measure love, hope, pain. You can‚Äôt measure empathy. 
But you can observe it. And I believe the non-autistic minds of the world have been observing us incorrectly, from their fixed point in time & space. There remains a chasm between us when it comes to understanding the realms of the mind. So how dare they deem us as ‚Äúless‚Äù as ‚Äúother‚Äù as ‚Äúsub-human‚Äù.

Our hearts, minds, senses are full in an ever abundant world filled with misunderstandings & misinterpretation of our presence; I recommend you check out Dr Damion Milton‚Äôs work on ‚ÄúDouble Empathy Theory‚Äù

My Little Cockatoo iPhone case that I‚Äôve carried in my hands the past two years ... if you looked closely during those years of me travelling the UK in my chair, or standing rookedly with with my crutch, you‚Äôll have seen, the Little Cockatoo was wearing rollarskates.

I‚Äôd sit in my chair, doing my sit down stim dances or I‚Äôd whip my leg over my crutch practicing my balance & strengthing my muscles....then collapsing a week before the chair, physio, crutch, chair, physio, crutch 

I faced so much ridicule & ablism for maintaining my body in the way that I have; through bed rest, mobility aids, splints, braces, to how I dance, my stims, and now my rollarskating. 

But like many of you, I‚Äôm still overcoming that ridicule in order to persist, to thrive to SURVIVE; for me & my son.

So more moments of joy like this can occur - and I‚Äôll grab it with my heart because none of us knows what is around the corner; I still sublux, I still sprain & injure myself

And that‚Äôs because Yup, I‚Äôm still Disabled - you can‚Äôt excercise or healthy eat a collagen disorder into oblivion. You can maintain it though. My Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - Hypermobile/Classic, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome & pots will need management as I age. 

It just means I have to work harder and pay harder for any mobility I do. So when & while I can...I‚Äôm going to grab both sets of skates by the hands, whip them on my feet and continue to dance, move & try until its physically unwise for me to do so.

TRIGGER WARNINGS - abuse, trauma, bullying, murder

An Autistic, Neurodivergent & Mental Health critical film PERSPECTIVE from one of last year‚Äôs most discussed and controversial film; JOKER

This was the first time I had watched this movie and it took me three sittings to complete it due to its traumatic content.

The Joker ""Villian"" archetype from the 70s- until now has been reduced to just that...a mindless Criminal. In this latest rendition, I analyze the film from a socio-political and neurodivergent perspective.

I'm looking at HOW Arthur became the Joker. And if the film helps the plight of people who are ""mentally ill"" or whether it creates more fear around victims of trauma or neurodiverse people?

For me, towards the finale...the film crosses a line ""Do you know what you get when you invite lonely mentally ill people?...You get what you deserve"" I'm lonely and mentally ill in people's eyes but im not shooting people or on a rampage.

So what will the audience take away from this? Will they idenitfy the complex mix of environmental, social, domestic, systemic government failures of Gotham City?

Or will they use Arthur's trauma and continue to blame the individual, to further see us as a threat?

I‚Äôm autistic. I also have Ehlers Danlos syndrome. And Stim dancing is an adaptive way of coping & expressing myself emotionally. It also was my main form of physio before I became ill over winter from trauma related stress.

Stimming helps me in regulating emotions; the good, bad & everything in between and also because I enjoy the feeling of moving my body in an expressive way. 

Watching this back and seeing my slow decline in mental health since October has been painful though; seeing the hope, love & optimism I had six months ago drift into apathy, fear and isolation. It made me see what I almost lost; my sense of self. 

I found my Stim dancing to be of little to no comfort to my torture during those months. I‚Äôve had to reclaim my Stim dancing for me this new decade. 

And I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm using MY coping strategies again, once more, without ridicule. Moving forward for me. 

And yes, I am still an ambulatory Wheelchair user. I use my powerchair to keep up with my autistic son & to see places I couldn‚Äôt without it.

A mix of expressive Disability dance, autistic stimming, Body Movement politics and the right to occupy public spaces like anybody else. 

I hope to appear in Liverpool this week.

Here goes...

‚ÄúMy name is Sara Harvey and I am autistic. I had no idea that I was autistic though, until five years ago when I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. 

I thought I was just crazy. I thought I was just insane. I thought there was something really wrong with me for being autistic, for being different, even though all my difference was was that this world was a bit too bright, bit too loud, bit too busy. A lot. A lot scary, and I didn‚Äôt know how to navigate it. 

So being in school was really traumatic for me. I do consider myself quite a privileged autistic, in that I am here today to even say these words. The biggest killer of autistic people, my loves, is epilepsy and suicide, and I know that both of those things are preventable. 

It hurts me getting messages - I‚Äôm an online advocate, autistic advocate, Agony Autie is my blog, we get messages day in and day out from children terrified to go to school because they stim. So some children can‚Äôt speak, some autistics will never speak, some autistics may need lifelong care, some autistics may need holistic support, but most of all we just need your understanding and your patience, and to know we are not a threat. 

This is not a threat. It‚Äôs just a part of being autistic which I do when I‚Äôm very nervous, and I‚Äôm very nervous. So I choose to stim dance, I chose, um, instead of hurting myself and whacking at myself and I‚Äôd get upset and have a meltdown, an autistic meltdown, overload, I choose to regulate my breathing, I choose to stim and tic, and hum, and rock, and tap, but it‚Äôs difficult when there are people around me. 

Security guards, hospital staff, teachers, parents, people who should know this is distress, or just sometimes autistic joy. So I‚Äôm here today in the streets to be visible, and if you do know anyone who‚Äôs autistic or if you‚Äôre autistic yourself, I invite you to write a message on a little person here. Tell me why you‚Äôre autistic and proud or tell me what needs to change. 

Because I am proud to be autistic despite the shame placed on me for being very different. 

Um, so, I‚Äôm gonna do a stim dance and this one‚Äôs dedicated to Oliver McGowan. Justice for Oliver Oliver, I do this in his name, because Oliver was an epileptic 18 year old autistic man, young man. Teenager. 18 year old Oliver McGowan was taken to hospital during an epileptic fit, and despite being scared, he persistently said ‚Äòsorry‚Äô for being autistic and afraid. 

Oliver, when afraid, said ‚ÄòI will be okay I am going to America and I‚Äôm going to meet-‚Äò. They saw this as psychosis. And against his parent‚Äôs wishes, Oliver was put on antipsychotic medication, causing him to go brain dead. He died shortly after. 

This is what his mother said, his mother said they stole her son. Many autistic people with learning disabilities are in crisis when in A&E. And sadly for Oliver, his autism was labelled as delusional, which resulted in them giving him antipsychotics which they knew he was allergic to, they knew he was allergic to them, but they wanted to control all of this. The distress. 

He just needed a calm safe space, all our hospitals need autism policies, our schools need autism policies. Our towns, our streets, need autism policies. 

Where are the autistics? There are 1 in 80 to 1 in 100 autistics with a footfall of 30,000 in Chester, where are they? 

Families are often too afraid to bring their kids out, they‚Äôre often afraid to come out in the streets. We need to create safer spaces. 

Oliver is no longer with us and it was entirely avoidable so I do this stim dance for Oliver, and for every single autistic who has lost their life to being so misunderstood with their behaviours, and I am so lucky to be here so thank you, thank you so much for listening to me, it‚Äôs my first ever street performance. 

Thank you for taking the time to stop and listen to me. Thank you.

Remember people like Oliver because they‚Äôre no longer here with us. This could be my son. Can you please defend autistic people with all of your might. Thank you for watching. I‚Äôm gonna go and get a cup of tea!‚Äù",9064,436,0,582,false,public,"[array([[[0, 0, 2],

Dr Damian Milton is a lecturer at The Tizard Centre at University of Kent and as an openly autistic person & father, he is an inspiration to me. He‚Äôs working on changing the narrative around autism and they that we are understood.

He is the person responsible for working towards tearing down the myth that Autistic People ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have empathy‚Äù

Inspirational talks and speakers not afraid to say it like it is. Open & honest discussion on how to revitalise and reimagine the recruiting sector.

With five stages my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt watch MORE speeches! 

On the RL100 Stage I talked with Bill Boorman on how to encourage recruiting practices and workplace cultures to ensure Autistic & Neurodiverse candidates felt welcome. 

We talked about differences in communication & work styles and how diversity in learning can enhance a workforce.

We looked at environmental changes, that could be made for Autistic people and adaptations. 

I talked about my lived experience and stigma within seeking and maintaining employment and how I found myself again. 

I spoke to so many people before and after the talk; I would love to connect or collaborate to talk more on 

Autistic & Neurodiversity
Disabled & differently abled
Mental Health (Depression, Anxiety & Trauma) 
Sensory Profiles and Learning Environment 

Thank you Jamie & Lois Leonard for taking such good care of me as a speaker- for ensuring all my access and travel was organised and for staying with me a whole hour to ensure I got home. Absolute dedication!

But over the last nine weeks, I‚Äôm learning more on how to adaptively cope with my anxiety, overload and triggers to post trauma. And I didn‚Äôt want to hide that from you just because I‚Äôm scared of being judged. 

Stimming, tapping, rocking & being quiet and zoning out like in this video, has helped me with my breathing, racing negative thoughts, not hitting my head and overall anxiety. 

Sometimes I Stim Dance, other times I‚Äôll grab my squish items or a mediative glitter ball.

But other times I just have to let the emotions course through my arms, chest, head, heart, mind and rock with them, breathe through them until they pass.

When distressed, I move my breath from chest to my diaphragm (to stop me panting) and tap away my awful painful feelings and move how my body needs to.

For me THIS PREVENTS MELTDOWN...the only issue is that to members of the public and people who don‚Äôt know me, such open Autistic distress and coping behaviour is misinterpreted and misunderstood.

This is why I Advocate for a ‚ÄúSafe Space‚Äù, Calm Rooms or Quiet Rooms in schools, workplaces, cinemas, shopping centres and eventually within towns & cities themselves.

Many people, like myself need a few minutes to process, think, calm our fight/flight systems and just BREATHE.

Too often our distress is seen as disruptive behaviour due to lack of training, awareness and space for people to calm within. This can end in dire consequences for the autistic or distressed individual in need of a safe environment... from enforcement control to school exclusion. 

I‚Äôm a big fan therefore of the ‚ÄúJust A Minute‚Äù (JAM) scheme which has been rolled out across train stations and train staff to be aware of someone in a panic attack, the needs of cognitive neurodiversity and adaptations for learning disabilities. 

More importantly they are taught how to respond. Calling the police on people in distress is an act of control and coercion.

The way forward is education, training, Acceptance of difficult emotions and plans with how to respond. To protect the person in distress & empower those around to respond. 

The way forward is a kinder more empathetic society and world. 

It starts with VISIBILITY of adaptive (positive) coping skills & techniques. It‚Äôs why I encourage my followers on Instagram especially to #embracethestim share their favourite #stims #visualstims #asmr & #stimdance 

So if you see me in the corner of the room, looking like this...don‚Äôt be alarmed or afraid. Ask if I need any support but be aware there may not be anything you can do accept be a safe, calm, quiet, reassuring, validating & accepting person x

Do you visually stim too? If so, what are YOUR visual stims?

PHOTOSENSITIVE & SENSORY WARNING: glimmering lights

Everyone stims differently, uniquely and sometimes discreetly. But for autistic people, such as myself, stimming can be a vital part of our daily lives.

It's frustrating that my stimming is often misinterpreted for daydreaming, boredom or me being ""just plain rude!""

But I can promise, however,  that I actually can listen without giving you my eyes - in fact, I process what you are saying much more clearly when I look away and stim as you are talking. Often my mind imagines what you are saying in the form of pictures/video.

Listening is with the ears and mind afterall...not the eyes.

This video was Sponsored by Guyatt House Care who financed the production of this video. They have hired me to meet and deliver training next month in our first booking event and are proud ""Embracers of the Stim"". #sponsorship #sponsor #sponsoredvideo #promotion

Polar Moon very kindly sent us a free ""Roly Moly"" as a Stim Gift. I plan to do a review in the next month #freebie #review

I‚Äôm 32 years old and use the board due to my loose joints & collegen (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome) and heart (Postural Orstatic Tacychardia syndrome)

It means I can shower without risk of falling, reducing the risk of fainting or injuring myself. Meaning I get some privacy & a bit of independency.

The shower/bath board was recommended & ordered via a Home Occupational Therapist Visit - as we rent from a private landlord, this was the most non-invasive way of introducing an adaptation aid to the property. 
I dream of one day having my own home, full of the aids & fixtures I require to be mobility aided throughout my own living space;like many of you in private rent, I don‚Äôt currently have that access. 

I rely on my husband who is my carer to help me out and dry me every time, as I have difficulty even regulating my temperature. It‚Äôs ok to need help everyday.

My six year old autistic son Frank allowed me to Stim Dance all around him; as a way to communicate, to interact and create a shared moment together.

It‚Äôs remarkable because my beautiful Frank has oppositional & avoidance behaviours due to sensory & anxiety. For him to permit me into his space & create an interactive zone out for him....it meant EVERYTHING to me!

This is what I mean by better ways than ABA or PBS conversation therapies; my son is pre-verbal causing him great frustration üò¢ It‚Äôs up to me to communicate to Frank using more than just words. To create human to human moments where he feels valued, understood & safe. 
It‚Äôs about finding the route into your autistic loved ones life; by being open not judgemental. By meeting us with curiosity instead of treating us with suspicion.
By echoing your child‚Äôs likes, their behaviour and letting them know you accept them for them. 
This absolutely hurt the living daylights out of me, but was totally worth it for my boy üíô

In July 2018 Agony Autie hosted Chester's Autistic Pride event, welcoming peers, friends & allies of the Autistic Community.

With Autistic poetry, musical performances, impromptu Stim-Dances and speeches being delivered throughout the day, Chester Autistic Pride 2018 aims to showcase the rich diversity that exists within our autistic community.

Delivered by Autistic people, for Autistic people.

Thank you to our incredible performers, speakers and to everyone who helped make this Pride event happen.

I hold it in‚Äîeven when it's streaming from every muscle fibre & nerve in my body. Sensory & emotional pain is another invisible state... panic, PTSD, depression, overload or cognitive confusion can render me a mess.

I'm 31. Last year I hid and was too scared to do what I'm doing now. Loosing my mobility and becoming partially mobile has made my life damn hard.

I can't change that. But WE can change our infrastructure, our attitudes & our society to enable disabled people to become enabled to life the best life we can possibly lead.

Thank you so much Mercy Charpentier for organizing an Autistic Pride by Autistics, for Autistics. You and everyone else who we spoke to there were an absolute pleasure to meet.

""We are stronger together. It‚Äôs why Pride matters. It‚Äôs what unites us in the face of shame, stigma, bullying, discrimination and abuse. Pride offers an alternative. So I choose Pride. Not fear.""

I have crippling low-self esteem, raging anxiety and a tenancy to freeze (shut down). Here are my attempts at speaking, which were cut from the final video.

Looking back, it saddens me to see the little belief I had in myself at the time. I look back now and I feel proud that I pushed through and didn't give up on what has turned out to be the most important speech of my life so far.

Transcribed & SUBTITLED video COMING SOON (upload tomorrow - sorry for the delay)

Agony Autie talks with Steve Silberman about his book ""Neurotribes"", Recognising Autistic Culture & Idenity, the Medical Narrative, his role within the Autistic Community and the current discussion of Hans Aspergers and his complitcy with the Nazi regime, according the Edith Sheffer's upcoming book.

You may find the discussion and images surrounding Autistic Mistreatment, Abuse and Nazi Eugenics distressing. At the time of our disussion,

NOTE: I was not aware that Temple Grandin was a Key Speaker at TACA, at the time of this recording. If I was, I would have raised this for discussion with Steve, as TACAs aims are the complete opposite to those laid out in Silberman's Neurotribes, and with my believes. I oppose TACA and their use of Chelation therapy for autistic people.

It was an absoultue honour to have ""Papa Steve"" on the show - we hope to invite him back another day.

It‚Äôs the...2nd March. I am in the Chester Countess Hospital and I am reading Steve Silberman‚Äôs Neurotribes and oh my goodness me‚Ä¶to say it‚Äôs helping me through this is an understatement. 

My visit here has reminded me of one of the last cornerstones of autism rhetoric that we really need to challenge. Maybe even prioritize above everything else‚Äîand that is the medical dialogue of autism. It drips down and drip feeds into everything. It drips into other rhetorics. 

Because it‚Äôs science, right? It‚Äôs medical. It‚Äôs fact. But the reality is, as Steve Silberman points out, is that the medical community‚Äîfor hundreds of years‚Äîhave treated autistic patients and disabled patients abhorrently.

They‚Äôve never really been held accountable for it. People think it doesn‚Äôt happen today so much, but it does. Discrimination, gaslighting, ableism, autistic denial, neurotypical lying and bullying, medical neglect..

Are still perpetrated towards autistics today.

The medical community have been the most responsible for loss of life towards autistics. They‚Äôve institutionalized us, brutalized us, sectioned us, experimented on us, led to suicides‚Äîbecause hey, when we go to A&E, when we‚Äôre suicidal autistics, they‚Äôll call security on you, if you have a meltdown. They make you feel like a criminal in your time of most need.

And it is that medical community today that still control much of the narrative surrounding MY, and YOUR, autistic identity. Your autistic personhood. Your autistic behaviours and your personality. 

All medicalized. All documented; all abnormal, weird, strange‚Äîthings that need to be cured. Things that need to be figured out and eradicated because‚Ä¶

They‚Äôre on the spectrum.

MUSIC BY LENA RAINE ""RESURRECTIONS"" 

Because it shatters me that ABA therapies still to this day, serve to irradicate our natural Autistic function to stim, zone-out, look away etc

It haunts me to read of the abusive Holding Therapy in the 1970s* designed for parents, therapists & care practitioners to bully, abuse and literally squash & stamp out our ways of interacting with this world. (*Steve Silberman - Neurotribes)

Such methods traumatize our Autistic Subjectivity; pausing but often shattering what was once natural to us.

Such ""therapies"" claim success by spouting ""Cure"" rhetoric, when in reality they have accomplished nothing more than moulding the autistic person (often temporarily) into the compliant & responsive docile Echo, of who you want them to be; accomplished through ""therapies"" which are founded in fear and practiced through domination, resulting in forced submissive control over the autistic individual.

I don't see a cure. I do see a Suffocation. And any person who forcibly wears that mask will begin to suffocate from the trauma, loss of identity, sense of self, growing up unsure of what is natural or normal for them; THE AUTISTIC.

Stimming, openly, in the way I am able to do via Agony Autie in 2018, is not only part of my autistic person-hood, but it's a damn PRIVILEGE. It is a privilege, because many of our autistic community are still being suffocated when it comes to being our autistic-selves. Not the masked-echo.

So if you can, Stim! Find your safe-stims, find what makes you happy and create the environment to reclaim what was always yours anyway. Because if you can, it is your privilege.

I hope that sharing one another's stimming and the narrative surrounding our ""behaviours"", could play a small part in extending that privilege afield to more autistic people one day.

Music is my emotional therapy! Today's improvised stim dance involved controlled, safe stims, tapping, zone outs and meditation. Many thanks to Lena Raine for her beautiful track, ""Resurrections"" from the awesome video game ""Celeste"" (which among many things, is about mental health and overcoming anxiety)

Hope this inspires you to Take back the Stim! Embrace the Stim! Control the Stim, your way!

FAQ
1) Can people with out autism have a meltdown? 

""Yes absolutely- we just seem to have them really intense, personally I have them a lot and my son every other few days to weeks, depending how he's feeling. The meltdown in itself is an explosion of fear, anger, anxiety, lack of control. My meltdowns are a fight/flight response to stimuli that my body interprets to be a threat even when it's not, eg, too much white/crowd noise, too much spoken or auditory language processing, too much light, too much touch or input from other people, or even trying to communicate with ppl can all be everyday triggers that build to the point a meltdown response explodes out of me. Some autistic ppl will feel this way so often, it really affects their life, their ability to communicate and be safe."" - Sara Xxx",10601,317,0,605,false,public,"[array([[[1, 0, 2],

(Captions available)

If you're autistic like me, then I'm sure you experienced the dreaded meltdowns! I'll make it clear though; a meltdown is not a temper tantrum, or spitting out our dummies. It's a very real, very physical feeling and it can get scary right? 
It can feel like absolute despair... & even when your mind tries to make sense of the emotions, our bodies have already responded to the 'trigger'. 

I don't know about you, but I'll begin stimmimg and humming and crying and I don't want to...it feels like it takes over and it won't stop so you bang your head or hurt yourself to snap out of it if you can. 

And that's what im talking about in my video; finding other ways to release that rage or upset, but in a safe way so you don't hurt yourself. It is no easy picnic trying to navigate these intense feelings of loss & isolation when the 'perceived threat' in hindsight, isn't a threat at all.
