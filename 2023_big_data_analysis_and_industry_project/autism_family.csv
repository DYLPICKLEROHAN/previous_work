Once you've printed out and taken the test you can take it to your doctor or other professional in your area who can assess it and give you further help. It’s free if you take it along with you on an annual physical checkup and have insurance or Medicaid, etc. not free if you have to pay for a doctors visit. Sorry I wasn’t more clear on that point.

Sometimes it helps to hear reasons they do not have autism. Even though we've covered similar ground in the past, when things are heard in the opposite way, the brain can form new connections and thoughts can click into place more easily. [EDIT]: We have a follow up video based on a lot of questions we received to this one. We cover things like Autism being a spectrum, masking, mis-diagnosis and under-diagnosing, etc. You can click the video link just below this sentence, thanks!

Please comment and let us know how you are dealing with this issue and what works/ does not work.
Also, I've been getting a lot of questions and concerns about why I failed to carry my son down the stairs. Thanks for the concern, but to answer in a pinned comment, I've had knee surgeries on both legs. Sometimes I get ""dead leg"" where one of my knees bends very quickly and I stumble. I didn't want to risk dropping my rather large son. Please understand we care about our son dearly, it had nothing to do with neglect. Thank you.

Where would they fall on the list? Kenai is amazing and you can see lots of ocean life on a clear day (our day was rainy on the ferry) as well as a couple of tidewater glaciers. A great experience and it would probably fall somewhere near the end of our list (maybe #7 or 8), due to cost and limited accessibility to park features. Denali would also be near the bottom of the list (maybe #9), though it has amazing wilderness and we saw 2 bull moose fighting, it takes a really long time to get to it, has one main road that eventually requires riding a long bus tour, and the main attraction (mount Denali) is only visible 30% of the time (we never saw it). Having said all of this, if they ever turn Prince William Sound into a national park, that would be near the top of our list. It was me and my wife's favorite part of the Alaska trip: Lots of glaciers, lots of wildlife, lots of pristine forest and islands, just beautiful...
...This list covers the Western USA and features photos in 4k.  Please feel free to ask us any questions you have about the parks. If you have trouble viewing the video try using a computer or tablet instead of a mobile phone. Hopefully Youtube will fix the issue soon. :)

Update: Yellowstone lake is not the highest fresh water lake in the USA, it's the largest lake at high elevation in the USA (over 7000 ft.). I knew better, but rushed the script and voice over, so it made it into the video (oops).

Cameras used: Panasonic GH4, GF6, Canon T2i, Point-and-shoots, GoPro 4 Silver, Samsung and Apple phones.
