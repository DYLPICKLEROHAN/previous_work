I talk about all things Autistic, mostly focusing on women and adults.

In today's video, I talk about how discontinuing products, whether it's soap, laundry detergent, food, toilet paper- anything, can hurt autistic people. 

Why does it hurt us? Often times, autistic people are extremely highly sensitive and change is very difficult for us. Scents of products can be very overpowering for our brains and cause us to have meltdowns, so if we find one product we like and then it suddenly disappears, it can be very hard for us because one, it's a change, and two, because we may not be able to find another scent we like. Same goes for food and anything else.

I know talking about this makes me sound like a big pain in the butt and very entitled, but I have no control over my brain's response to these things. If I could deal with any product just fine, I WOULD! Because who would choose to have meltdowns over their soap being discontinued on purpose?!

Thank you for all of your support! Please like and subscribe! God Bless!

Thank you so much for tuning into another video of mine. Please be respectful in the comments are I will turn them off. 

This video talks all about Autism and vaccines. After seeing an ignorant post on Instagram correlating the increase in vaccines to the increase in Autism, I just had to make a video on the subject. Vaccines do NOT cause Autism! This is a myth. I go over where this myth came from and then talk about why it's false in this video. 

Correlation does not equal causation.

My name is Olivia Hops and in today's video I talk about how our Autistic brain's hyperfocus ability can come with a negative side affect: becoming too obsessive with things, including with unhealthy/bad things.

Autism and eating disorders are linked (check out my friend  @Liv Label Free  for more details), and in 8th grade, I myself become obsessive with diet and exercise to the point where I developed an eating disorder.

I've been scared to try to work out regularly ever since. But then I found CoPilot! Check them out through the link above.

1. Hyper Focus
2. Honesty
3. Big Imagination
4. Fine Being Alone
5. Great Hearing
6. Being a Tomboy
7. Great Long-Term Memory

Thank you so much for all of the continued support!

My name is Olivia Hops, and in today's video I talk about 6 hacks/tips that can help you manage your Autistic Traits/Symptoms and help you stay regulated.

The 6 Tips are listed below:
1. Sensory Hacks (Wear Headphones/Sunglasses/ETC)
2. Take Breaks (also from Social Media)
3. Learn How to Say ""No""
4. Go to Therapy
5. Spoon Method (Do things you like to counterbalance the things you don't)
6. Start Journaling

Please remember, I am not a doctor and these suggestions are just based off of my personal experience as one person on the Autism Spectrum. Every Autistic Person is different, so some of these tips may not work for you.

In this week's video, I talk about the importance of taking Mental Health Breaks. Taking Mental Health Breaks, whether they're just a day or two or up to months (like I do), can keep your Autism traits in check (like anxiety, depression, meltdowns, etc.) and keep your overall Mental Health healthy. It also keeps you working at your best and at full capacity.

I give you 10 tips on how to help your loved one who is experiencing a meltdown get through their meltdown and how to help them recover from a meltdown.

I also go over the difference between Empathy vs. Sympathy. During a meltdown, show your Autistic loved one EMPATHY, not SYMPATHY.

***Check out the awesome Empathy vs. Sympathy animated short I talk about in this video by Dr. Bren√© Brown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBTYViDPlQ&t=51s

Please keep in mind that these tips are based off of what works for me personally as an Autistic adult and when I was an undiagnosed Autistic child/teen. No two Autistic people are the same, so just because these tips work for me, they may not work for your loved one.

3. I'm so sorry...
4. Stop labeling yourself.
5. Everyone's a little autistic.
6. You must have been misdiagnosed.
7. You're nothing like X who has autism that I know.
8. Were you vaccinated?
9. X can cure that!
10. But you're so pretty and smart and outgoing!

My name is Olivia Hops and in this week's video I go over 10 Autistic Traits that I do NOT have.

The point of this video is to show you that all autistic people are different, and just because you don't have all of my traits doesn't mean you're NOT autistic. Of course, the flip side is true, too. Just because you have some of my traits doesn't mean you for sure are autistic either. Only a licensed professional or doctor can officially diagnose someone with ASD.

If you have any questions to ask my mom about raising me while (unknowingly) autistic, please leave them down below or email me at olivia@autisticallyme.com!

I'm also going to start coaching and online courses to take to help you live your best life while autistic! If you're interested in that, please let me know below or through email as well!

-----10 Autism Traits I DON'T Have---
1. I can understand sarcasm
2. I don't stim very much
3. I wasn't bullied in school
4. I don't have a monotone voice
5. I don't have a lack of imagination
6. I don't need a strict routine
7. I don't organize things repeatedly
8. I don't have bad fine motor skills
9. I'm not obsessed with numbers/math/science
10. I'm not bad at socializing

My name is Olivia Hops and welcome to my video! In this week's video, I talk about Autistic Shutdowns. I go through what they are, what causes them, symptoms of them, and my person experience with them. I also go over autistic shutdowns vs. autistic meltdowns.

Remember, no two autistic people are alike, so if you experience shutdowns differently than how I do or how I talk about them in this video, don't worry! This does NOT make your shutdown experiences any less valid.

Please like and subject, and most importantly, share this video! My goal is to bring awareness to females on the spectrum, so the more people who see these videos, the better. :)

In today's video, I'm giving you guys a pep talk. The reason? I want you all to know that you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to! 

Don't let your age, a disability, education level - anything - stop you from going for your dreams and achieving them. 

I had many people tell me my big dreams were unattainable, but I have achieved every single thing (minus keeping a plan alive...) that I have ever set my mind on doing. You can, too!

Don't listen to ANYONE who tells you otherwise. They don't know your dreams (watch the video for what Steve Harvey did when someone told him he was never going to be on TV). If I had listened to some of even my closest family and friends, I wouldn't be where I am today. 

You may fail, it may sting, but never quit. Keep going. The saying goes, ""I didn't fail, I just found a way NOT to do something.""

 Also, college does NOT equal success. And no college does not equal a miserable life (despite what many people told me). If college isn't for you, that's 1000% okay. There are so many other ways to learn, such as internships, which is what I did. 

If you need any help with any of your dreams, please don't hesitate to reach out. I would love to help you if there is any way that I can. 

Believe in yourself and keep going. And don't wait! You never know when your last day on Earth might be.

I go over why the ""high"" and ""low"" functioning labels don't work. Autism isn't a linear line, but a giant circle with endless possibilities! Just because someone may appear ""high"" functioning, it doesn't mean they don't have struggles. It doesn't make them any ""less"" Autistic. It just means they're better at hiding their autistic traits to appear ""normal.""

Today‚Äôs video is about another 10 Female Autistic Traits that affect me on a regular basis!


In this video, I talk about 10 more autistic traits that affect me on a regular basis. I go over needing a routine, my bad habit of burning bridges, masking, and special interests.


Many times when boys and girls have similar autistic traits, males get diagnosed, but females often do not. Females tend to get diagnosed only when their autistic traits are significantly and visibly debilitating. Clinicians are missing many girls who are on the less disabling end of the autism spectrum because we are often so good at hiding our autistic traits.


Although these traits are very common in girls and women, boys and men can have them, too! Traits are not exclusive to one gender. Also, please remember that not everyone will have these traits. Every autistic person is different, just like every neurotypical person is! And just because you have some of these traits does not make you autistic, and just because you DON'T have some of these traits doesn't make you NOT autistic. Only a doctor can officially diagnosis.


Girls are so often misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed with autism until well into adulthood. Please help spread awareness to girls and women on the spectrum by sharing this video. My goal with this video is to help other people ""figure themselves out,"" just like my adult autism diagnosis did for me. Getting young girls diagnosed could change their lives and allow them to not deal with as many of the struggles I did growing up because I had no idea what was ""wrong"" with me.


10 More Female Autistic Traits:
‚Ä¢ Masking
‚Ä¢ Burnout
‚Ä¢ Bridge Burning
‚Ä¢ Few Friends/Prefer Males/Prefer Adults/Prefer 1 on 1 Time
‚Ä¢ Special Interests
‚Ä¢ Overshare
‚Ä¢ Struggle with Hygiene
‚Ä¢ Confused About Sexuality
‚Ä¢ Superior IQ
‚Ä¢ Need Routines

Autism spectrum disorder is a condition that affects the way people behave, socialize, and communicate with others. This disorder is commonly referred to simply as autism. It used to be broken down into sub-types, such as Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, but it‚Äôs now treated as a condition with a wide-ranging spectrum of symptoms and severity.

This video is sponsored by BetterHelp.

In this week's video, I talk about all things Autism and Mental Health. I discuss the differences between Mental Disorders (like anxiety and depression) and Developmental Disorders (like Autism), how Autism and mental illness are often comorbid, the mental health issues I deal with, and my thoughts on seeking help from a therapist.

Even though this video is sponsored, these thoughts are my own. Even if this video was not sponsored, I would be giving going to therapy a glowing review (I already had a video about this planned before it was sponsored). I LOVE therapy. I have gone to therapy for over a decade, starting at the age of 13. I have always found it helpful and enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone struggling, whether your Autistic or not.

I'd also like to emphasize that seeking help from a professional is NOT in anyway bad. It does not make you weak, less of a human, or any other negative connotation that often goes along with seeing a therapist. In fact, acknowledging that you need help and wanting to work on yourself makes you BRAVE and STRONG!

I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to get this video done. Thank you so much for patiently waiting for it. I hope it lives up to your expectations.

In this video, I talk about all things Autism and Romantic Relationships. I talk about how crushes always grossed me out growing up, how I thought I'd never be able to settle down, how if I got married I'd need my own house away from my husband (LOL), my feelings on intimacy, and a little bit about my boyfriend Alex and our long-term relationship.

After that, I bring the one-and-only Alex (who's very shy and not so great on camera...) into the video with me to answer YOUR questions you asked us!

Thank you so much for supporting me! I hope you enjoy, and as always, God Bless!

This week's episode is on non-romantic relationships throughout my life. Stay tuned for the second part of this video about romantic relationships, featuring my boyfriend, Alex!


Some of the things are talk about in this video are about how relationships are hard work for me, and I know many other people on the spectrum. I also discuss burning bridges, something I've always done and always feel guilty for!

I go over what it is, it's pros and cons, why we mask, and some examples of how I mask/have masked in my like.


While females on the spectrum are usually very highly skilled at masking, men can be maskers, too! No autistic trait is exclusive to one gender. Skilled masking may just be more common in females. Many females don't even know that what they're doing has a name. Masking is exhausting, but being able to take the mask off is near impossible for a lot of us.

I talk about my experiences as a child, my triggers, the aftermath of having one, and some tips that can help me when I feel one coming on. 



In this video I include actual footage of me having a meltdown. It was a more minor one and on the tail end of it, but someone once asked me to see what an actual meltdown looked like, so I filmed a few seconds of one. It could be a trigger for some people, so please watch with digression. I do put a warning before it pops up, so you will be notified before it plays so that you can skip it if you need to.

This video is a downer and very intense. Please watch at your own discretion (TW).


In the video, I talk about what depression looks like in me when it hits me hard. I feel guilty for everything and like I don't deserve all the amazing things God has blessed me with. Depression is not something you can just make go away. It is a disease, and you are not alone if you experience depression.


If you do experience depression, don't be afraid to go see and talk to someone about it. I have seen a therapist since I was 14 years old, and it has always helped me. Just getting your feelings out of your body can help. If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out to a help hotline, or even me if you need.


Always remember, your life is WORTH it. YOU are worth it!! No matter what your brain tells you, you are amazing and your life matters.

Today‚Äôs video is about my Top 10 Female Autistic Traits.


In this video, I talk about 10 autistic traits that affect me on a regular basis and share my experience getting diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 24 years old. I go over my sensory issues, from needing certain sheets to not eating certain foods to not being able to go to movie theaters. I also cover a TMI topic: gut issues! They're related to autism. Who knew?! I also talk about a very common autism trait: having a hard time with change.


Many times when boys and girls have similar autistic traits, males get diagnosed, but females often do not. Females tend to get diagnosed only when their autistic traits are significantly and visibly debilitating. Clinicians are missing many girls who are on the less disabling end of the autism spectrum because we are often so good at hiding our autistic traits.


Although these traits are very common in girls and women, boys and men can have them, too! Traits are not exclusive to one gender. Also, please remember that not everyone will have these traits. Every autistic person is different, just like every neurotypical person is! And just because you have some of these traits does not make you autistic, and just because you DON'T have some of these traits doesn't make you NOT autistic. Only a doctor can officially diagnosis.


Girls are so often misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed with autism until well into adulthood. Please help spread awareness to girls and women on the spectrum by sharing this video. My goal with this video is to help other people ""figure themselves out,"" just like my adult autism diagnosis did for me. Getting young girls diagnosed could change their lives and allow them to not deal with as many of the struggles I did growing up because I had no idea what was ""wrong"" with me.


My Top 10 Female Autistic Traits:
‚Ä¢ Sensory Issues
‚Ä¢ Mental Illnesses
‚Ä¢ Inflexibility
‚Ä¢ Difficulty/Dislike Socializing
‚Ä¢ Selective mutism
‚Ä¢ Black and white logical thinker
‚Ä¢ Gut Issues
‚Ä¢  Long-term and Short-term Memory
‚Ä¢ Meltdowns
‚Ä¢ Struggle with Empathy


Autism spectrum disorder is a condition that affects the way people behave, socialize, and communicate with others. This disorder is commonly referred to simply as autism. It used to be broken down into sub-types, such as Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, but it‚Äôs now treated as a condition with a wide-ranging spectrum of symptoms and severity.

Please enjoy and make sure to watch the video until the end to gain extra knowledge! Thank you so much for watching and I will see you in the next one!
