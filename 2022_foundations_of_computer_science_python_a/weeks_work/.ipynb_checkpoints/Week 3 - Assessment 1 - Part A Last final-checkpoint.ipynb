    "### Final answer to Q3\n",
    "The final problem to over come was seperating the daysOver code and placing that in a loop. Python wasn't having it. After some debugging I found the problem, the file was either closing or not being reread after the first iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "With some help from Paypal I was finally I able to get to answering the question properly. Below you will find the code needed to define a function with dictionary, filename, and temperature parameters. The dictionary is the name of the nested dictionary uploaded from the input CSV file. Filename is the name the user wishes the output CSV file to have. And Temperature marks the threshold the maximum temperature needs to pass in order to be included in the frequency count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to consider:\n",
    "- Empty cells/ missing values are not identified by the reader, only placed in as 0.\n",
    "- I have removed columns with MaxTemp data set to NA, this may introduce a skew. \n",
    "- This function will only work on a file named 'weatherAus-1.csv' with column headers 'Location' and 'MaxTemp'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function iterates thorugh a list of cities including 'Adelaide', 'Perth', 'Melbourne', 'Canberra', 'Sydney', 'Brisbane', and 'Darwin' and uses the modified daysOver() function to compile a list of instances in which the temperature paramater was exceeded in the nested dictionary the user indicated with the dictionary paramater. After each iteration of a city in the cities list, the writeTempsData() seeks the start of the file and reads it with DictReader() from the csv module before calling the daysOver function. The numerical output is appended to a values list which is then bound to a key/city in the cities list within a dictionary. That dictionary is then written as a csv file that I have formatted to remove the empty that appears in the example given as seen when you load the 'test123.csv' file in excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have put all the code required to answer this question in the same block for your convinience as I know I've jumped back and forth a fair bit:"
